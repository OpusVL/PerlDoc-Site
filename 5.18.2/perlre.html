<p>perlre - Perl regular expressions</p>
<a id="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class='h2' >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This page describes the syntax of regular expressions in Perl.</p>
<p>If you haven't used regular expressions before, a quick-start
introduction is available in <a href="perlrequick.html">perlrequick</a>, and a longer tutorial
introduction is available in <a href="perlretut.html">perlretut</a>.</p>
<p>For reference on how regular expressions are used in matching
operations, plus various examples of the same, see discussions of
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m//</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr//</a></code> and <pre>
<span class="q">??</span></code>
 in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">Regexp Quote-Like Operators in perlop</a>.</p>
<a id="Modifiers"></a><h3 class='h3' >Modifiers</h3>
<p>Matching operations can have various modifiers.  Modifiers
that relate to the interpretation of the regular expression inside
are listed below.  Modifiers that alter the way a regular expression
is used by Perl are detailed in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">Regexp Quote-Like Operators in perlop</a> and
<a href="perlop.html#Gory-details-of-parsing-quoted-constructs">Gory details of parsing quoted constructs in perlop</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="m"></a><strong>m
   </strong>
<p>Treat string as multiple lines.  That is, change "^" and "$" from matching
the start or end of line only at the left and right ends of the string to
matching them anywhere within the string.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="s"></a><strong>s
  
</strong>
<p>Treat string as single line.  That is, change "." to match any character
whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match.</p>
<p>Used together, as <code class="inline">/ms</code>, they let the "." match any character whatsoever,
while still allowing "^" and "$" to match, respectively, just after
and just before newlines within the string.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="i"></a><strong>i
  
</strong>
<p>Do case-insensitive pattern matching.</p>
<p>If locale matching rules are in effect, the case map is taken from the
current
locale for code points less than 255, and from Unicode rules for larger
code points.  However, matches that would cross the Unicode
rules/non-Unicode rules boundary (ords 255/256) will not succeed.  See
<a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of Unicode characters that match multiple characters
under <code class="inline">/i</code>.  For example, <pre>
<span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LIGATURE</span> <span class="w">FI</span></code>

should match the sequence <pre>
<span class="w">fi</span></code>
.  Perl is not
currently able to do this when the multiple characters are in the pattern and
are split between groupings, or when one or more are quantified.  Thus</p>
<pre>
 <span class="q">&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/fi/i</span><span class="sc">;</span>          <span class="c"># Matches</span>
 <span class="q">&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/[fi][fi]/i</span><span class="sc">;</span>    <span class="c"># Doesn&#39;t match!</span>
 <span class="q">&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/fi*/i</span><span class="sc">;</span>         <span class="c"># Doesn&#39;t match!</span>

 <span class="c"># The below doesn&#39;t match, and it isn&#39;t clear what $1 and $2 would</span>
 <span class="c"># be even if it did!!</span>
 <span class="q">&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/(f)(i)/i</span><span class="sc">;</span>      <span class="c"># Doesn&#39;t match!</span></pre>
<p>Perl doesn't match multiple characters in a bracketed
character class unless the character that maps to them is explicitly
mentioned, and it doesn't match them at all if the character class is
inverted, which otherwise could be highly confusing.  See
<a href="perlrecharclass.html#Bracketed-Character-Classes">Bracketed Character Classes in perlrecharclass</a>, and
<a href="perlrecharclass.html#Negation">Negation in perlrecharclass</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="x"></a><strong>x
</strong>
<p>Extend your pattern's legibility by permitting whitespace and comments.
Details in <a href="#%2fx">/x</a></p>
</li>
<li><a id="p"></a><strong>p
  </strong>
<p>Preserve the string matched such that ${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH}, and
${^POSTMATCH} are available for use after matching.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="g-and-c"></a><strong>g and c
 </strong>
<p>Global matching, and keep the Current position after failed matching.
Unlike i, m, s and x, these two flags affect the way the regex is used
rather than the regex itself. See
<a href="perlretut.html#Using-regular-expressions-in-Perl">Using regular expressions in Perl in perlretut</a> for further explanation
of the g and c modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="a%2c-d%2c-l-and-u"></a><strong>a, d, l and u
   </strong>
<p>These modifiers, all new in 5.14, affect which character-set semantics
(Unicode, etc.) are used, as described below in
<a href="#Character-set-modifiers">Character set modifiers</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular expression modifiers are usually written in documentation
as e.g., "the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier", even though the delimiter
in question might not really be a slash.  The modifiers <code class="inline">/imsxadlup</code>
may also be embedded within the regular expression itself using
the <code class="inline">(?...)</code> construct, see <a href="#Extended-Patterns">Extended Patterns</a> below.</p>
<a id="%2fx"></a><h4 class='h4' >/x</h4>
<p><code class="inline">/x</code> tells
the regular expression parser to ignore most whitespace that is neither
backslashed nor within a character class.  You can use this to break up
your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts.  The <pre>
<span class="c">#</span></code>

character is also treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment,
just as in ordinary Perl code.  This also means that if you want real
whitespace or <pre>
<span class="c">#</span></code>
 characters in the pattern (outside a character
class, where they are unaffected by <code class="inline">/x</code>), then you'll either have to
escape them (using backslashes or <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span>...\<span class="w">E</span></code>
) or encode them using octal,
hex, or <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 escapes.  Taken together, these features go a long way towards
making Perl's regular expressions more readable.  Note that you have to
be careful not to include the pattern delimiter in the comment--perl has
no way of knowing you did not intend to close the pattern early.  See
the C-comment deletion code in <a href="perlop.html">perlop</a>.  Also note that anything inside
a <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span>...\<span class="w">E</span></code>
 stays unaffected by <code class="inline">/x</code>.  And note that <code class="inline">/x</code> doesn't affect
space interpretation within a single multi-character construct.  For
example in <pre>
\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, regardless of the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier, there can be no
spaces.  Same for a <a href="#Quantifiers">quantifier</a> such as <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or
<pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
.  Similarly, <code class="inline">(?:...)</code> can't have a space between the <code class="inline">(</code>,
<code class="inline">?</code>, and <pre>
<span class="j">:</span></code>
.  Within any delimiters for such a
construct, allowed spaces are not affected by <code class="inline">/x</code>, and depend on the
construct.  For example, <pre>
\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 can't have spaces because hexadecimal
numbers don't have spaces in them.  But, Unicode properties can have spaces, so
in <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 there can be spaces that follow the Unicode rules, for which see
<a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>.
</p>
<a id="Character-set-modifiers"></a><h4 class='h4' >Character set modifiers</h4>
<p><code class="inline">/d</code>, <code class="inline">/u</code>, <code class="inline">/a</code>, and <code class="inline">/l</code>, available starting in 5.14, are called
the character set modifiers; they affect the character set semantics
used for the regular expression.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">/d</code>, <code class="inline">/u</code>, and <code class="inline">/l</code> modifiers are not likely to be of much use
to you, and so you need not worry about them very much.  They exist for
Perl's internal use, so that complex regular expression data structures
can be automatically serialized and later exactly reconstituted,
including all their nuances.  But, since Perl can't keep a secret, and
there may be rare instances where they are useful, they are documented
here.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">/a</code> modifier, on the other hand, may be useful.  Its purpose is to
allow code that is to work mostly on ASCII data to not have to concern
itself with Unicode.</p>
<p>Briefly, <code class="inline">/l</code> sets the character set to that of whatever <strong>L</strong>ocale is in
effect at the time of the execution of the pattern match.</p>
<p><code class="inline">/u</code> sets the character set to <strong>U</strong>nicode.</p>
<p><code class="inline">/a</code> also sets the character set to Unicode, BUT adds several
restrictions for <strong>A</strong>SCII-safe matching.</p>
<p><code class="inline">/d</code> is the old, problematic, pre-5.14 <strong>D</strong>efault character set
behavior.  Its only use is to force that old behavior.</p>
<p>At any given time, exactly one of these modifiers is in effect.  Their
existence allows Perl to keep the originally compiled behavior of a
regular expression, regardless of what rules are in effect when it is
actually executed.  And if it is interpolated into a larger regex, the
original's rules continue to apply to it, and only it.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">/l</code> and <code class="inline">/u</code> modifiers are automatically selected for
regular expressions compiled within the scope of various pragmas,
and we recommend that in general, you use those pragmas instead of
specifying these modifiers explicitly.  For one thing, the modifiers
affect only pattern matching, and do not extend to even any replacement
done, whereas using the pragmas give consistent results for all
appropriate operations within their scopes.  For example,</p>
<pre>
 <span class="q">s/foo/\Ubar/il</span></pre>
<p>will match "foo" using the locale's rules for case-insensitive matching,
but the <code class="inline">/l</code> does not affect how the <pre>
\<span class="w">U</span></code>
 operates.  Most likely you
want both of them to use locale rules.  To do this, instead compile the
regular expression within the scope of <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
.  This both
implicitly adds the <code class="inline">/l</code> and applies locale rules to the <pre>
\<span class="w">U</span></code>
.   The
lesson is to <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
 and not <code class="inline">/l</code> explicitly.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would be better to use <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">&#39;unicode_strings&#39;</span></code>

instead of,</p>
<pre>
 <span class="q">s/foo/\Lbar/iu</span></pre>
<p>to get Unicode rules, as the <pre>
\<span class="w">L</span></code>
 in the former (but not necessarily
the latter) would also use Unicode rules.</p>
<p>More detail on each of the modifiers follows.  Most likely you don't
need to know this detail for <code class="inline">/l</code>, <code class="inline">/u</code>, and <code class="inline">/d</code>, and can skip ahead
to <a href="#%2fa-(and-%2faa)">/a</a>.</p>
<h5 class='h5'>/l</h5>
<p>means to use the current locale's rules (see <a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a>) when pattern
matching.  For example, <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
 will match the "word" characters of that
locale, and <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;/i&quot;</span></code>
 case-insensitive matching will match according to
the locale's case folding rules.  The locale used will be the one in
effect at the time of execution of the pattern match.  This may not be
the same as the compilation-time locale, and can differ from one match
to another if there is an intervening call of the
<a href="perllocale.html#The-setlocale-function">setlocale() function</a>.</p>
<p>Perl only supports single-byte locales.  This means that code points
above 255 are treated as Unicode no matter what locale is in effect.
Under Unicode rules, there are a few case-insensitive matches that cross
the 255/256 boundary.  These are disallowed under <code class="inline">/l</code>.  For example,
0xFF (on ASCII platforms) does not caselessly match the character at
0x178, <pre>
<span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">CAPITAL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">Y</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code>
, because 0xFF may not be
<pre>
<span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">Y</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code>
 in the current locale, and Perl
has no way of knowing if that character even exists in the locale, much
less what code point it is.</p>
<p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
, but
see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3f">Which character set modifier is in effect?</a>.
</p>
<h5 class='h5'>/u</h5>
<p>means to use Unicode rules when pattern matching.  On ASCII platforms,
this means that the code points between 128 and 255 take on their
Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) meanings (which are the same as Unicode's).
(Otherwise Perl considers their meanings to be undefined.)  Thus,
under this modifier, the ASCII platform effectively becomes a Unicode
platform; and hence, for example, <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
 will match any of the more than
100_000 word characters in Unicode.</p>
<p>Unlike most locales, which are specific to a language and country pair,
Unicode classifies all the characters that are letters <i>somewhere</i> in
the world as
<pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
.  For example, your locale might not think that <pre>
<span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">SMALL</span>
<span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">ETH</span></code>
 is a letter (unless you happen to speak Icelandic), but
Unicode does.  Similarly, all the characters that are decimal digits
somewhere in the world will match <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
; this is hundreds, not 10,
possible matches.  And some of those digits look like some of the 10
ASCII digits, but mean a different number, so a human could easily think
a number is a different quantity than it really is.  For example,
<pre>
<span class="w">BENGALI</span> <span class="w">DIGIT</span> <span class="w">FOUR</span></code>
 (U+09EA) looks very much like an
<pre>
<span class="w">ASCII</span> <span class="w">DIGIT</span> <span class="w">EIGHT</span></code>
 (U+0038).  And, <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span>+</code>
, may match strings of digits
that are a mixture from different writing systems, creating a security
issue.  <a href="Unicode/UCD.html#num()">num() in Unicode::UCD</a> can be used to sort
this out.  Or the <code class="inline">/a</code> modifier can be used to force <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 to match
just the ASCII 0 through 9.</p>
<p>Also, under this modifier, case-insensitive matching works on the full
set of Unicode
characters.  The <pre>
<span class="w">KELVIN</span> <span class="w">SIGN</span></code>
, for example matches the letters "k" and
"K"; and <pre>
<span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LIGATURE</span> <span class="w">FF</span></code>
 matches the sequence "ff", which,
if you're not prepared, might make it look like a hexadecimal constant,
presenting another potential security issue.  See
<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr36">http://unicode.org/reports/tr36</a> for a detailed discussion of Unicode
security issues.</p>
<p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <code class="inline">use feature
'unicode_strings</code>, <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span> <span class="q">&#39;:not_characters&#39;</span></code>
, or
<code class="inline"><a href="functions/use.html">use VERSION</a></code> (or higher),
but see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3f">Which character set modifier is in effect?</a>.
</p>
<h5 class='h5'>/d</h5>
<p>This modifier means to use the "Default" native rules of the platform
except when there is cause to use Unicode rules instead, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1</dt><dd>
<p>the target string is encoded in UTF-8; or</p>
</dd>
<dt>2</dt><dd>
<p>the pattern is encoded in UTF-8; or</p>
</dd>
<dt>3</dt><dd>
<p>the pattern explicitly mentions a code point that is above 255 (say by
<pre>
\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">100</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
); or</p>
</dd>
<dt>4</dt><dd>
<p>the pattern uses a Unicode name (<pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
);  or</p>
</dd>
<dt>5</dt><dd>
<p>the pattern uses a Unicode property (<pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
); or</p>
</dd>
<dt>6</dt><dd>
<p>the pattern uses <a href="#(%3f%5b-%5d)">(?[ ])</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another mnemonic for this modifier is "Depends", as the rules actually
used depend on various things, and as a result you can get unexpected
results.  See <a href="perlunicode.html#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">The Unicode Bug in perlunicode</a>.  The Unicode Bug has
become rather infamous, leading to yet another (printable) name for this
modifier, "Dodgy".</p>
<p>Unless the pattern or string are encoded in UTF-8, only ASCII characters
can match positively.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how that works on an ASCII platform:</p>
<pre>
 <span class="i">$str</span> =  <span class="q">&quot;\xDF&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>      <span class="c"># $str is not in UTF-8 format.</span>
 <span class="i">$str</span> =~ <span class="q">/^\w/</span><span class="sc">;</span>       <span class="c"># No match, as $str isn&#39;t in UTF-8 format.</span>
 <span class="i">$str</span> .= <span class="q">&quot;\x{0e0b}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>  <span class="c"># Now $str is in UTF-8 format.</span>
 <span class="i">$str</span> =~ <span class="q">/^\w/</span><span class="sc">;</span>       <span class="c"># Match! $str is now in UTF-8 format.</span>
 <a class="l_k" href="functions/chop.html">chop</a> <span class="i">$str</span><span class="sc">;</span>
 <span class="i">$str</span> =~ <span class="q">/^\w/</span><span class="sc">;</span>       <span class="c"># Still a match! $str remains in UTF-8 format.</span></pre>
<p>This modifier is automatically selected by default when none of the
others are, so yet another name for it is "Default".</p>
<p>Because of the unexpected behaviors associated with this modifier, you
probably should only use it to maintain weird backward compatibilities.</p>
<h5 class='h5'>/a (and /aa)</h5>
<p>This modifier stands for ASCII-restrict (or ASCII-safe).  This modifier,
unlike the others, may be doubled-up to increase its effect.</p>
<p>When it appears singly, it causes the sequences <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
, <code class="inline">\s</code>, <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
, and
the Posix character classes to match only in the ASCII range.  They thus
revert to their pre-5.6, pre-Unicode meanings.  Under <code class="inline">/a</code>,  <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>

always means precisely the digits <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;0&quot;</span></code>
 to <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;9&quot;</span></code>
; <code class="inline">\s</code> means the five
characters <pre>
<span class="s">[</span> \<span class="w">f</span>\<span class="w">n</span>\<span class="w">r</span>\<span class="w">t</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
, and starting in Perl v5.18, experimentally,
the vertical tab; <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
 means the 63 characters
<pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Za</span>-<span class="w">z0</span>-<span class="n">9_</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
; and likewise, all the Posix classes such as
<code class="inline">[[:print:]]</code> match only the appropriate ASCII-range characters.</p>
<p>This modifier is useful for people who only incidentally use Unicode,
and who do not wish to be burdened with its complexities and security
concerns.</p>
<p>With <code class="inline">/a</code>, one can write <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 with confidence that it will only match
ASCII characters, and should the need arise to match beyond ASCII, you
can instead use <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 (or <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Word</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 for <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
).  There are
similar <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 constructs that can match beyond ASCII both white
space (see <a href="perlrecharclass.html#Whitespace">Whitespace in perlrecharclass</a>), and Posix classes (see
<a href="perlrecharclass.html#POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes in perlrecharclass</a>).  Thus, this modifier
doesn't mean you can't use Unicode, it means that to get Unicode
matching you must explicitly use a construct (<pre>
\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) that
signals Unicode.</p>
<p>As you would expect, this modifier causes, for example, <pre>
\<span class="w">D</span></code>
 to mean
the same thing as <code class="inline">[^0-9]</code>; in fact, all non-ASCII characters match
<pre>
\<span class="w">D</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">S</span></code>
, and <pre>
\<span class="w">W</span></code>
.  <pre>
\<span class="w">b</span></code>
 still means to match at the boundary
between <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="w">W</span></code>
, using the <code class="inline">/a</code> definitions of them (similarly
for <pre>
\<span class="w">B</span></code>
).</p>
<p>Otherwise, <code class="inline">/a</code> behaves like the <code class="inline">/u</code> modifier, in that
case-insensitive matching uses Unicode semantics; for example, "k" will
match the Unicode <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">KELVIN</span> <span class="w">SIGN</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching, and code
points in the Latin1 range, above ASCII will have Unicode rules when it
comes to case-insensitive matching.</p>
<p>To forbid ASCII/non-ASCII matches (like "k" with <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">KELVIN</span> <span class="w">SIGN</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
),
specify the "a" twice, for example <code class="inline">/aai</code> or <code class="inline">/aia</code>.  (The first
occurrence of "a" restricts the <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
, etc., and the second occurrence
adds the <code class="inline">/i</code> restrictions.)  But, note that code points outside the
ASCII range will use Unicode rules for <code class="inline">/i</code> matching, so the modifier
doesn't really restrict things to just ASCII; it just forbids the
intermixing of ASCII and non-ASCII.</p>
<p>To summarize, this modifier provides protection for applications that
don't wish to be exposed to all of Unicode.  Specifying it twice
gives added protection.</p>
<p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;/a&#39;</span></code>

or <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;/aa&#39;</span></code>
.  If you do so, you may actually have occasion to use
the <code class="inline">/u</code> modifier explictly if there are a few regular expressions
where you do want full Unicode rules (but even here, it's best if
everything were under feature <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;unicode_strings&quot;</span></code>
, along with the
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;/aa&#39;</span></code>
).  Also see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3f">Which character set modifier is in effect?</a>.

</p>
<h5 class='h5'>Which character set modifier is in effect?</h5>
<p>Which of these modifiers is in effect at any given point in a regular
expression depends on a fairly complex set of interactions.  These have
been designed so that in general you don't have to worry about it, but
this section gives the gory details.  As
explained below in <a href="#Extended-Patterns">Extended Patterns</a> it is possible to explicitly
specify modifiers that apply only to portions of a regular expression.
The innermost always has priority over any outer ones, and one applying
to the whole expression has priority over any of the default settings that are
described in the remainder of this section.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline"><a href="re.html#'%2fflags'-mode">use re '/foo'</a></code> pragma can be used to set
default modifiers (including these) for regular expressions compiled
within its scope.  This pragma has precedence over the other pragmas
listed below that also change the defaults.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <code class="inline"><a href="perllocale.html">use locale</a></code> sets the default modifier to <code class="inline">/l</code>;
and <code class="inline"><a href="feature.html">use feature 'unicode_strings</a></code>, or
<code class="inline"><a href="functions/use.html">use VERSION</a></code> (or higher) set the default to
<code class="inline">/u</code> when not in the same scope as either <code class="inline"><a href="perllocale.html">use locale</a></code>
or <code class="inline"><a href="bytes.html">use bytes</a></code>.
(<code class="inline"><a href="perllocale.html#Unicode-and-UTF-8">use locale ':not_characters'</a></code> also
sets the default to <code class="inline">/u</code>, overriding any plain <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
.)
Unlike the mechanisms mentioned above, these
affect operations besides regular expressions pattern matching, and so
give more consistent results with other operators, including using
<pre>
\<span class="w">U</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">l</span></code>
, etc. in substitution replacements.</p>
<p>If none of the above apply, for backwards compatibility reasons, the
<code class="inline">/d</code> modifier is the one in effect by default.  As this can lead to
unexpected results, it is best to specify which other rule set should be
used.</p>
<h5 class='h5'>Character set modifier behavior prior to Perl 5.14</h5>
<p>Prior to 5.14, there were no explicit modifiers, but <code class="inline">/l</code> was implied
for regexes compiled within the scope of <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
, and <code class="inline">/d</code> was
implied otherwise.  However, interpolating a regex into a larger regex
would ignore the original compilation in favor of whatever was in effect
at the time of the second compilation.  There were a number of
inconsistencies (bugs) with the <code class="inline">/d</code> modifier, where Unicode rules
would be used when inappropriate, and vice versa.  <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 did not imply
Unicode rules, and neither did all occurrences of <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, until 5.12.</p>
<a id="Regular-Expressions"></a><h3 class='h3' >Regular Expressions</h3>
<a id="Metacharacters"></a><h4 class='h4' >Metacharacters</h4>
<p>The patterns used in Perl pattern matching evolved from those supplied in
the Version 8 regex routines.  (The routines are derived
(distantly) from Henry Spencer's freely redistributable reimplementation
of the V8 routines.)  See <a href="#Version-8-Regular-Expressions">Version 8 Regular Expressions</a> for
details.</p>
<p>In particular the following metacharacters have their standard <i>egrep</i>-ish
meanings:

        </p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    \        Quote the next metacharacter</li><li>    ^        Match the beginning of the line</li><li>    .        Match any character (except newline)</li><li>    $        Match the end of the line (or before newline at the end)</li><li>    |        Alternation</li><li>    ()       Grouping</li><li>    []       Bracketed Character class</li></ol></div><p>By default, the "^" character is guaranteed to match only the
beginning of the string, the "$" character only the end (or before the
newline at the end), and Perl does certain optimizations with the
assumption that the string contains only one line.  Embedded newlines
will not be matched by "^" or "$".  You may, however, wish to treat a
string as a multi-line buffer, such that the "^" will match after any
newline within the string (except if the newline is the last character in
the string), and "$" will match before any newline.  At the
cost of a little more overhead, you can do this by using the /m modifier
on the pattern match operator.  (Older programs did this by setting <pre>
<span class="i">$*</span></code>
,
but this option was removed in perl 5.10.)
  </p>
<p>To simplify multi-line substitutions, the "." character never matches a
newline unless you use the <code class="inline">/s</code> modifier, which in effect tells Perl to pretend
the string is a single line--even if it isn't.
 </p>
<a id="Quantifiers"></a><h4 class='h4' >Quantifiers</h4>
<p>The following standard quantifiers are recognized:
       </p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    *           Match 0 or more times</li><li>    +           Match 1 or more times</li><li>    ?           Match 1 or 0 times</li><li>    {n}         Match exactly n times</li><li>    {n,}        Match at least n times</li><li>    {n,m}       Match at least n but not more than m times</li></ol></div><p>(If a curly bracket occurs in any other context and does not form part of
a backslashed sequence like <pre>
\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, it is treated as a regular
character.  In particular, the lower quantifier bound is not optional,
and a typo in a quantifier silently causes it to be treated as the
literal characters.  For example,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/o{4,3}/</span></pre>
<p>looks like a quantifier that matches 0 times, since 4 is greater than 3,
but it really means to match the sequence of six characters
<pre>
<span class="q">&quot;o { 4 , 3 }&quot;</span></code>
.  It is planned to eventually require literal uses
of curly brackets to be escaped, say by preceding them with a backslash
or enclosing them within square brackets, (<pre>
<span class="q">&quot;\{&quot;</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;[{]&quot;</span></code>
).  This
change will allow for future syntax extensions (like making the lower
bound of a quantifier optional), and better error checking.  In the
meantime, you should get in the habit of escaping all instances where
you mean a literal "{".)</p>
<p>The "*" quantifier is equivalent to <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, the "+"
quantifier to <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, and the "?" quantifier to <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
.  n and m are limited
to non-negative integral values less than a preset limit defined when perl is built.
This is usually 32766 on the most common platforms.  The actual limit can
be seen in the error message generated by code such as this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> **= <span class="i">$_</span> <span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">/ {$_} /</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/for.html">for</a> <span class="n">2</span> .. <span class="n">42</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>By default, a quantified subpattern is "greedy", that is, it will match as
many times as possible (given a particular starting location) while still
allowing the rest of the pattern to match.  If you want it to match the
minimum number of times possible, follow the quantifier with a "?".  Note
that the meanings don't change, just the "greediness":
  
      </p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    *?        Match 0 or more times, not greedily</li><li>    +?        Match 1 or more times, not greedily</li><li>    ??        Match 0 or 1 time, not greedily</li><li>    {n}?      Match exactly n times, not greedily (redundant)</li><li>    {n,}?     Match at least n times, not greedily</li><li>    {n,m}?    Match at least n but not more than m times, not greedily</li></ol></div><p>By default, when a quantified subpattern does not allow the rest of the
overall pattern to match, Perl will backtrack. However, this behaviour is
sometimes undesirable. Thus Perl provides the "possessive" quantifier form
as well.</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> *+     Match 0 or more times and give nothing back</li><li> ++     Match 1 or more times and give nothing back</li><li> ?+     Match 0 or 1 time and give nothing back</li><li> {n}+   Match exactly n times and give nothing back (redundant)</li><li> {n,}+  Match at least n times and give nothing back</li><li> {n,m}+ Match at least n but not more than m times and give nothing back</li></ol></div><p>For instance,</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">&#39;aaaa&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/a++a/</span></pre>
<p>will never match, as the <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>++</code>
 will gobble up all the <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
's in the
string and won't leave any for the remaining part of the pattern. This
feature can be extremely useful to give perl hints about where it
shouldn't backtrack. For instance, the typical "match a double-quoted
string" problem can be most efficiently performed when written as:</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">/&quot;(?:[^&quot;\\]++|\\.)*+&quot;/</span></pre>
<p>as we know that if the final quote does not match, backtracking will not
help. See the independent subexpression
<a href="#(%3f%3epattern)">(?&gt;pattern)</a> for more details;
possessive quantifiers are just syntactic sugar for that construct. For
instance the above example could also be written as follows:</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">/&quot;(?&gt;(?:(?&gt;[^&quot;\\]+)|\\.)*)&quot;/</span></pre>
<a id="Escape-sequences"></a><h4 class='h4' >Escape sequences</h4>
<p>Because patterns are processed as double-quoted strings, the following
also work:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> \t          tab                   (HT, TAB)</li><li> \n          newline               (LF, NL)</li><li> \r          return                (CR)</li><li> \f          form feed             (FF)</li><li> \a          alarm (bell)          (BEL)</li><li> \e          escape (think troff)  (ESC)</li><li> \cK         control char          (example: VT)</li><li> \x{}, \x00  character whose ordinal is the given hexadecimal number</li><li> \N{name}    named Unicode character or character sequence</li><li> \N{U+263D}  Unicode character     (example: FIRST QUARTER MOON)</li><li> \o{}, \000  character whose ordinal is the given octal number</li><li> \l          lowercase next char (think vi)</li><li> \u          uppercase next char (think vi)</li><li> \L          lowercase till \E (think vi)</li><li> \U          uppercase till \E (think vi)</li><li> \Q          quote (disable) pattern metacharacters till \E</li><li> \E          end either case modification or quoted section, think vi</li></ol></div><p>Details are in <a href="perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators">Quote and Quote-like Operators in perlop</a>.</p>
<a id="Character-Classes-and-other-Special-Escapes"></a><h4 class='h4' >Character Classes and other Special Escapes</h4>
<p>In addition, Perl defines the following:

<a id="Assertions"></a><h4 class='h4' >Assertions</h4>
<p>Perl defines the following zero-width assertions:
  


     </p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    \b  Match a word boundary</li><li>    \B  Match except at a word boundary</li><li>    \A  Match only at beginning of string</li><li>    \Z  Match only at end of string, or before newline at the end</li><li>    \z  Match only at end of string</li><li>    \G  Match only at pos() (e.g. at the end-of-match position</li><li>        of prior m//g)</li></ol></div><p>A word boundary (<pre>
\<span class="w">b</span></code>
) is a spot between two characters
that has a <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
 on one side of it and a <pre>
\<span class="w">W</span></code>
 on the other side
of it (in either order), counting the imaginary characters off the
beginning and end of the string as matching a <pre>
\<span class="w">W</span></code>
.  (Within
character classes <pre>
\<span class="w">b</span></code>
 represents backspace rather than a word
boundary, just as it normally does in any double-quoted string.)
The <pre>
\<span class="w">A</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="w">Z</span></code>
 are just like "^" and "$", except that they
won't match multiple times when the <code class="inline">/m</code> modifier is used, while
"^" and "$" will match at every internal line boundary.  To match
the actual end of the string and not ignore an optional trailing
newline, use <pre>
\<span class="w">z</span></code>
.
    </p>
<p>The <pre>
\<span class="w">G</span></code>
 assertion can be used to chain global matches (using
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m//g</a></code>), as described in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">Regexp Quote-Like Operators in perlop</a>.
It is also useful when writing <pre>
<span class="w">lex</span></code>
-like scanners, when you have
several patterns that you want to match against consequent substrings
of your string; see the previous reference.  The actual location
where <pre>
\<span class="w">G</span></code>
 will match can also be influenced by using <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pos.html">pos()</a></code> as
an lvalue: see <a href="functions/pos.html">pos</a>. Note that the rule for zero-length
matches (see <a href="#Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring">Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring</a>)
is modified somewhat, in that contents to the left of <pre>
\<span class="w">G</span></code>
 are
not counted when determining the length of the match. Thus the following
will not match forever:
</p>
<pre>
     <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$string</span> = <span class="q">&#39;ABC&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
     <a class="l_k" href="functions/pos.html">pos</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$string</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
     <a class="l_k" href="functions/while.html">while</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$string</span> =~ <span class="q">/(.\G)/g</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>
         <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="i">$1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
     <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>It will print 'A' and then terminate, as it considers the match to
be zero-width, and thus will not match at the same position twice in a
row.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that <pre>
\<span class="w">G</span></code>
 improperly used can result in an infinite
loop. Take care when using patterns that include <pre>
\<span class="w">G</span></code>
 in an alternation.</p>
<a id="Capture-groups"></a><h4 class='h4' >Capture groups</h4>
<p>The bracketing construct <pre>
<span class="s">(</span> ... <span class="s">)</span></code>
 creates capture groups (also referred to as
capture buffers). To refer to the current contents of a group later on, within
the same pattern, use <pre>
\<span class="w">g1</span></code>
 (or <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) for the first, <pre>
\<span class="w">g2</span></code>
 (or <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
)
for the second, and so on.
This is called a <i>backreference</i>.
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
  
There is no limit to the number of captured substrings that you may use.
Groups are numbered with the leftmost open parenthesis being number 1, etc.  If
a group did not match, the associated backreference won't match either. (This
can happen if the group is optional, or in a different branch of an
alternation.)
You can omit the <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;g&quot;</span></code>
, and write <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;\1&quot;</span></code>
, etc, but there are some issues with
this form, described below.</p>
<p>You can also refer to capture groups relatively, by using a negative number, so
that <pre>
\<span class="w">g</span>-<span class="n">1</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">-1</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 both refer to the immediately preceding capture
group, and <pre>
\<span class="w">g</span>-<span class="n">2</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">-2</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 both refer to the group before it.  For
example:</p>
<pre>
        <span class="q">/</span>
         <span class="q">         (Y)            # group 1</span>
         <span class="q">         (              # group 2</span>
            <span class="q">            (X)         # group 3</span>
            <span class="q">            \g{-1}      # backref to group 3</span>
            <span class="q">            \g{-3}      # backref to group 1</span>
         <span class="q">         )</span>
        <span class="q">        /x</span></pre>
<p>would match the same as <pre>
<span class="q">/(Y) ( (X) \g3 \g1 )/x</span></code>
.  This allows you to
interpolate regexes into larger regexes and not have to worry about the
capture groups being renumbered.</p>
<p>You can dispense with numbers altogether and create named capture groups.
The notation is <code class="inline">(?&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;...)</code> to declare and <code class="inline">\g{<i>name</i>}</code> to
reference.  (To be compatible with .Net regular expressions, <code class="inline">\g{<i>name</i>}</code> may
also be written as <code class="inline">\k{<i>name</i>}</code>, <code class="inline">\k&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;</code> or <code class="inline">\k'<i>name</i>'</code>.)
<i>name</i> must not begin with a number, nor contain hyphens.
When different groups within the same pattern have the same name, any reference
to that name assumes the leftmost defined group.  Named groups count in
absolute and relative numbering, and so can also be referred to by those
numbers.
(It's possible to do things with named capture groups that would otherwise
require <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="q">??</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.)</p>
<p>Capture group contents are dynamically scoped and available to you outside the
pattern until the end of the enclosing block or until the next successful
match, whichever comes first.  (See <a href="perlsyn.html#Compound-Statements">Compound Statements in perlsyn</a>.)
You can refer to them by absolute number (using <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;$1&quot;</span></code>
 instead of <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;\g1&quot;</span></code>
,
etc); or by name via the <pre>
<span class="i">%+</span></code>
 hash, using <code class="inline">"$+{<i>name</i>}"</code>.</p>
<p>Braces are required in referring to named capture groups, but are optional for
absolute or relative numbered ones.  Braces are safer when creating a regex by
concatenating smaller strings.  For example if you have <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr/$a$b/</a></code>, and <pre>
<span class="i">$a</span></code>

contained <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;\g1&quot;</span></code>
, and <pre>
<span class="i">$b</span></code>
 contained <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;37&quot;</span></code>
, you would get <pre>
<span class="q">/\g137/</span></code>
 which
is probably not what you intended.</p>
<p>The <pre>
\<span class="w">g</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="w">k</span></code>
 notations were introduced in Perl 5.10.0.  Prior to that
there were no named nor relative numbered capture groups.  Absolute numbered
groups were referred to using <pre>
\<span class="n">1</span></code>
,
<pre>
\<span class="n">2</span></code>
, etc., and this notation is still
accepted (and likely always will be).  But it leads to some ambiguities if
there are more than 9 capture groups, as <pre>
\<span class="n">10</span></code>
 could mean either the tenth
capture group, or the character whose ordinal in octal is 010 (a backspace in
ASCII).  Perl resolves this ambiguity by interpreting <pre>
\<span class="n">10</span></code>
 as a backreference
only if at least 10 left parentheses have opened before it.  Likewise <pre>
\<span class="n">11</span></code>
 is
a backreference only if at least 11 left parentheses have opened before it.
And so on.  <pre>
\<span class="n">1</span></code>
 through <pre>
\<span class="n">9</span></code>
 are always interpreted as backreferences.
There are several examples below that illustrate these perils.  You can avoid
the ambiguity by always using <pre>
\<span class="w">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">g</span></code>
 if you mean capturing groups;
and for octal constants always using <pre>
\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, or for <pre>
\<span class="n">077</span></code>
 and below, using 3
digits padded with leading zeros, since a leading zero implies an octal
constant.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">\<i>digit</i></code> notation also works in certain circumstances outside
the pattern.  See <a href="#Warning-on-%5c1-Instead-of-%241">Warning on \1 Instead of $1</a> below for details.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;     # swap first two words</li><li></li><li>    /(.)\g1/                        # find first doubled char</li><li>         and print "'$1' is the first doubled character\n";</li><li></li><li>    /(?&lt;char&gt;.)\k&lt;char&gt;/            # ... a different way</li><li>         and print "'$+{char}' is the first doubled character\n";</li><li></li><li>    /(?'char'.)\g1/                 # ... mix and match</li><li>         and print "'$1' is the first doubled character\n";</li><li></li><li>    if (/Time: (..):(..):(..)/) {   # parse out values</li><li>        $hours = $1;</li><li>        $minutes = $2;</li><li>        $seconds = $3;</li><li>    }</li><li></li><li>    /(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)\g10/   # \g10 is a backreference</li><li>    /(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)\10/    # \10 is octal</li><li>    /((.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.))\10/  # \10 is a backreference</li><li>    /((.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.))\010/ # \010 is octal</li><li></li><li>    $a = '(.)\1';        # Creates problems when concatenated.</li><li>    $b = '(.)\g{1}';     # Avoids the problems.</li><li>    "aa" =~ /${a}/;      # True</li><li>    "aa" =~ /${b}/;      # True</li><li>    "aa0" =~ /${a}0/;    # False!</li><li>    "aa0" =~ /${b}0/;    # True</li><li>    "aa\x08" =~ /${a}0/;  # True!</li><li>    "aa\x08" =~ /${b}0/;  # False</li></ol></div><p>Several special variables also refer back to portions of the previous
match.  <pre>
<span class="i">$+</span></code>
 returns whatever the last bracket match matched.
<pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
 returns the entire matched string.  (At one point <pre>
<span class="i">$0</span></code>
 did
also, but now it returns the name of the program.)  <pre>
<span class="i">$`</span></code>
 returns
everything before the matched string.  <pre>
<span class="i">$&#39;</span></code>
 returns everything
after the matched string. And <pre>
<span class="i">$^N</span></code>
 contains whatever was matched by
the most-recently closed group (submatch). <pre>
<span class="i">$^N</span></code>
 can be used in
extended patterns (see below), for example to assign a submatch to a
variable.
    </p>
<p>These special variables, like the <pre>
<span class="i">%+</span></code>
 hash and the numbered match variables
(<pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$2</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$3</span></code>
, etc.) are dynamically scoped
until the end of the enclosing block or until the next successful
match, whichever comes first.  (See <a href="perlsyn.html#Compound-Statements">Compound Statements in perlsyn</a>.)
    
        </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Failed matches in Perl do not reset the match variables,
which makes it easier to write code that tests for a series of more
specific cases and remembers the best match.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Once Perl sees that you need one of <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$`</span></code>
, or
<pre>
<span class="i">$&#39;</span></code>
 anywhere in the program, it has to provide them for every
pattern match.  This may substantially slow your program.  Perl
uses the same mechanism to produce <pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$2</span></code>
, etc, so you also pay a
price for each pattern that contains capturing parentheses.  (To
avoid this cost while retaining the grouping behaviour, use the
extended regular expression <code class="inline">(?: ... )</code> instead.)  But if you never
use <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$`</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">$&#39;</span></code>
, then patterns <i>without</i> capturing
parentheses will not be penalized.  So avoid <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$&#39;</span></code>
, and <pre>
<span class="i">$`</span></code>

if you can, but if you can't (and some algorithms really appreciate
them), once you've used them once, use them at will, because you've
already paid the price.  As of 5.17.4, the presence of each of the three
variables in a program is recorded separately, and depending on
circumstances, perl may be able be more efficient knowing that only <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>

rather than all three have been seen, for example.
  </p>
<p>As a workaround for this problem, Perl 5.10.0 introduces <pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">^PREMATCH</span>}</code>
,
<pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">^MATCH</span>}</code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">^POSTMATCH</span>}</code>
, which are equivalent to <pre>
<span class="i">$`</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>

and <pre>
<span class="i">$&#39;</span></code>
, <strong>except</strong> that they are only guaranteed to be defined after a
successful match that was executed with the <code class="inline">/p</code> (preserve) modifier.
The use of these variables incurs no global performance penalty, unlike
their punctuation char equivalents, however at the trade-off that you
have to tell perl when you want to use them.
 </p>
<a id="Quoting-metacharacters"></a><h3 class='h3' >Quoting metacharacters</h3>
<p>Backslashed metacharacters in Perl are alphanumeric, such as <pre>
\<span class="w">b</span></code>
,
<pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">n</span></code>
.  Unlike some other regular expression languages, there
are no backslashed symbols that aren't alphanumeric.  So anything
that looks like \\, \(, \), \[, \], \{, or \} is always
interpreted as a literal character, not a metacharacter.  This was
once used in a common idiom to disable or quote the special meanings
of regular expression metacharacters in a string that you want to
use for a pattern. Simply quote all non-"word" characters:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$pattern</span> =~ <span class="q">s/(\W)/\\$1/g</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>(If <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
 is set, then this depends on the current locale.)
Today it is more common to use the quotemeta() function or the <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span></code>

metaquoting escape sequence to disable all metacharacters' special
meanings like this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/$unquoted\Q$quoted\E$unquoted/</span></pre>
<p>Beware that if you put literal backslashes (those not inside
interpolated variables) between <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span></code>
 and <pre>
\<span class="w">E</span></code>
, double-quotish
backslash interpolation may lead to confusing results.  If you
<i>need</i> to use literal backslashes within <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span>...\<span class="w">E</span></code>
,
consult <a href="perlop.html#Gory-details-of-parsing-quoted-constructs">Gory details of parsing quoted constructs in perlop</a>.</p>
<p><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/quotemeta.html">quotemeta()</a></code> and <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span></code>
 are fully described in <a href="functions/quotemeta.html">quotemeta</a>.</p>
<a id="Extended-Patterns"></a><h3 class='h3' >Extended Patterns</h3>
<p>Perl also defines a consistent extension syntax for features not
found in standard tools like <strong>awk</strong> and
<strong>lex</strong>.  The syntax for most of these is a
pair of parentheses with a question mark as the first thing within
the parentheses.  The character after the question mark indicates
the extension.</p>
<p>The stability of these extensions varies widely.  Some have been
part of the core language for many years.  Others are experimental
and may change without warning or be completely removed.  Check
the documentation on an individual feature to verify its current
status.</p>
<p>A question mark was chosen for this and for the minimal-matching
construct because 1) question marks are rare in older regular
expressions, and 2) whenever you see one, you should stop and
"question" exactly what is going on.  That's psychology....</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="(%3f%23text)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?#text)</code>
</strong>
<p>A comment.  The text is ignored.  If the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier enables
whitespace formatting, a simple <pre>
<span class="c">#</span></code>
 will suffice.  Note that Perl closes

<p>One or more embedded pattern-match modifiers, to be turned on (or
turned off, if preceded by <pre>
-</code>
) for the remainder of the pattern or
the remainder of the enclosing pattern group (if any).</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for dynamic patterns, such as those read in from a
configuration file, taken from an argument, or specified in a table
somewhere.  Consider the case where some patterns want to be
case-sensitive and some do not:  The case-insensitive ones merely need to
include <code class="inline">(?i)</code> at the front of the pattern.  For example:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$pattern</span> = <span class="q">&quot;foobar&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/$pattern/i</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="s">}</span>

    <span class="c"># more flexible:</span>

    <span class="i">$pattern</span> = <span class="q">&quot;(?i)foobar&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/$pattern/</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>These modifiers are restored at the end of the enclosing group. For example,</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    ( (?i) blah ) \s+ \g1</li></ol></div><p>will match <pre>
<span class="w">blah</span></code>
 in any case, some spaces, and an exact (<i>including the case</i>!)
repetition of the previous word, assuming the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier, and no <code class="inline">/i</code>
modifier outside this group.</p>
<p>These modifiers do not carry over into named subpatterns called in the
enclosing group. In other words, a pattern such as <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?i)(?</span>&amp;<span class="w">NAME</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 does not
change the case-sensitivity of the "NAME" pattern.</p>
<p>Any of these modifiers can be set to apply globally to all regular
expressions compiled within the scope of a <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span></code>
.  See
<a href="re.html#'%2fflags'-mode">'/flags' mode in re</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.14, a <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;^&quot;</span></code>
 (caret or circumflex accent) immediately
after the <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;?&quot;</span></code>
 is a shorthand equivalent to <pre>
<span class="w">d</span>-<span class="w">imsx</span></code>
.  Flags (except
<pre>
<span class="q">&quot;d&quot;</span></code>
) may follow the caret to override it.
But a minus sign is not legal with it.</p>
<p>Note that the <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">d</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">l</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">p</span></code>
, and <pre>
<span class="w">u</span></code>
 modifiers are special in
that they can only be enabled, not disabled, and the <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">d</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">l</span></code>
, and
<pre>
<span class="w">u</span></code>
 modifiers are mutually exclusive: specifying one de-specifies the
others, and a maximum of one (or two <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
's) may appear in the
construct.  Thus, for
example, <code class="inline">(?-p)</code> will warn when compiled under <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">warnings</span></code>
;
<code class="inline">(?-d:...)</code> and <code class="inline">(?dl:...)</code> are fatal errors.</p>
<p>Note also that the <pre>
<span class="w">p</span></code>
 modifier is special in that its presence
anywhere in a pattern has a global effect.</p>

<p>This is for clustering, not capturing; it groups subexpressions like
"()", but doesn't make backreferences as "()" does.  So</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@fields</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">/\b(?:a|b|c)\b/</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>

<pre>
    <span class="i">@fields</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">/\b(a|b|c)\b/</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>but doesn't spit out extra fields.  It's also cheaper not to capture
characters if you don't need to.</p>
<p>Any letters between <code class="inline">?</code> and <pre>
<span class="j">:</span></code>
 act as flags modifiers as with
<code class="inline">(?adluimsx-imsx)</code>.  For example,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/(?s-i:more.*than).*million/i</span></pre>
<p>is equivalent to the more verbose</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/(?:(?s-i)more.*than).*million/i</span></pre>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.14, a <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;^&quot;</span></code>
 (caret or circumflex accent) immediately
after the <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;?&quot;</span></code>
 is a shorthand equivalent to <pre>
<span class="w">d</span>-<span class="w">imsx</span></code>
.  Any positive
flags (except <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;d&quot;</span></code>
) may follow the caret, so</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (?^x:foo)</li></ol></div><p>is equivalent to</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (?x-ims:foo)</li></ol></div><p>The caret tells Perl that this cluster doesn't inherit the flags of any
surrounding pattern, but uses the system defaults (<pre>
<span class="w">d</span>-<span class="w">imsx</span></code>
),
modified by any flags specified.</p>
<p>The caret allows for simpler stringification of compiled regular
expressions.  These look like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (?^:pattern)</li></ol></div><p>with any non-default flags appearing between the caret and the colon.
A test that looks at such stringification thus doesn't need to have the
system default flags hard-coded in it, just the caret.  If new flags are
added to Perl, the meaning of the caret's expansion will change to include
the default for those flags, so the test will still work, unchanged.</p>
<p>Specifying a negative flag after the caret is an error, as the flag is
redundant.</p>
<p>Mnemonic for <code class="inline">(?^...)</code>:  A fresh beginning since the usual use of a caret is
to match at the beginning.</p>

<li><a id="(%3f%7cpattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?|pattern)</code>
 </strong>
<p>This is the "branch reset" pattern, which has the special property
that the capture groups are numbered from the same starting point
in each alternation branch. It is available starting from perl 5.10.0.</p>
<p>Capture groups are numbered from left to right, but inside this
construct the numbering is restarted for each branch.</p>
<p>The numbering within each branch will be as normal, and any groups
following this construct will be numbered as though the construct
contained only one branch, that being the one with the most capture
groups in it.</p>
<p>This construct is useful when you want to capture one of a
number of alternative matches.</p>
<p>Consider the following pattern.  The numbers underneath show in
which group the captured content will be stored.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="c"># before  ---------------branch-reset----------- after        </span>
    <span class="q">/ ( a )  (?| x ( y ) z | (p (q) r) | (t) u (v) ) ( z ) /x</span>
    <span class="c"># 1            2         2  3        2     3     4</span></pre>
<p>Be careful when using the branch reset pattern in combination with 
named captures. Named captures are implemented as being aliases to 
numbered groups holding the captures, and that interferes with the
implementation of the branch reset pattern. If you are using named
captures in a branch reset pattern, it's best to use the same names,
in the same order, in each of the alternations:</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">/(?|  (?&lt;a&gt; x ) (?&lt;b&gt; y )</span>
      <span class="q">      |  (?&lt;a&gt; z ) (?&lt;b&gt; w )) /x</span></pre>
<p>Not doing so may lead to surprises:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">&quot;12&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/(?| (?&lt;a&gt; \d+ ) | (?&lt;b&gt; \D+))/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>
  <a class="l_k" href="functions/say.html">say</a> <span class="i">$+</span> {<span class="w">a</span>}<span class="sc">;</span>   <span class="c"># Prints &#39;12&#39;</span>
  <a class="l_k" href="functions/say.html">say</a> <span class="i">$+</span> {<span class="w">b</span>}<span class="sc">;</span>   <span class="c"># *Also* prints &#39;12&#39;.</span></pre>
<p>The problem here is that both the group named <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
 and the group
named <pre>
<span class="w">b</span></code>
 are aliases for the group belonging to <pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>
.</p>

<li><a id="Look-Around-Assertions"></a><strong>Look-Around Assertions
   </strong>
<p>Look-around assertions are zero-width patterns which match a specific
pattern without including it in <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
. Positive assertions match when
their subpattern matches, negative assertions match when their subpattern
fails. Look-behind matches text up to the current match position,
look-ahead matches text following the current match position.</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="(%3f%3dpattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?=pattern)</code>
  </strong>
<p>A zero-width positive look-ahead assertion.  For example, <pre>
<span class="q">/\w+(?=\t)/</span></code>

matches a word followed by a tab, without including the tab in <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f!pattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?!pattern)</code>
  </strong>
<p>A zero-width negative look-ahead assertion.  For example <pre>
<span class="q">/foo(?!bar)/</span></code>

matches any occurrence of "foo" that isn't followed by "bar".  Note
however that look-ahead and look-behind are NOT the same thing.  You cannot
use this for look-behind.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a "bar" that isn't preceded by a "foo", <pre>
<span class="q">/(?!foo)bar/</span></code>

will not do what you want.  That's because the <code class="inline">(?!foo)</code> is just saying that
the next thing cannot be "foo"--and it's not, it's a "bar", so "foobar" will
match.  Use look-behind instead (see below).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%3c%3dpattern)-%5cK"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?&lt;=pattern)</code> <pre>
\<span class="w">K</span></code>

   </strong>
<p>A zero-width positive look-behind assertion.  For example, <pre>
<span class="q">/(?&lt;=\t)\w+/</span></code>

matches a word that follows a tab, without including the tab in <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
.
Works only for fixed-width look-behind.</p>
<p>There is a special form of this construct, called <pre>
\<span class="w">K</span></code>
, which causes the
regex engine to "keep" everything it had matched prior to the <pre>
\<span class="w">K</span></code>
 and
not include it in <pre>
<span class="i">$&amp;</span></code>
. This effectively provides variable-length
look-behind. The use of <pre>
\<span class="w">K</span></code>
 inside of another look-around assertion
is allowed, but the behaviour is currently not well defined.</p>
<p>For various reasons <pre>
\<span class="w">K</span></code>
 may be significantly more efficient than the
equivalent <code class="inline">(?&lt;=...)</code> construct, and it is especially useful in
situations where you want to efficiently remove something following
something else in a string. For instance</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">s/(foo)bar/$1/g</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>can be rewritten as the much more efficient</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">s/foo\Kbar//g</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%3c!pattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?&lt;!pattern)</code>
  </strong>
<p>A zero-width negative look-behind assertion.  For example <pre>
<span class="q">/(?&lt;!bar)foo/</span></code>

matches any occurrence of "foo" that does not follow "bar".  Works
only for fixed-width look-behind.</p>

<p>A named capture group. Identical in every respect to normal capturing
parentheses <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 but for the additional fact that the group
can be referred to by name in various regular expression
constructs (like <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">NAME</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) and can be accessed by name
after a successful match via <pre>
<span class="i">%+</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">%-</span></code>
. See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>
for more details on the <pre>
<span class="i">%+</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">%-</span></code>
 hashes.</p>
<p>If multiple distinct capture groups have the same name then the
$+{NAME} will refer to the leftmost defined group in the match.</p>
<p>The forms <code class="inline">(?'NAME'pattern)</code> and <code class="inline">(?&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)</code> are equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While the notation of this construct is the same as the similar
function in .NET regexes, the behavior is not. In Perl the groups are
numbered sequentially regardless of being named or not. Thus in the
pattern</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/(x)(?&lt;foo&gt;y)(z)/</span></pre>
<p>$+{foo} will be the same as $2, and $3 will contain 'z' instead of
the opposite which is what a .NET regex hacker might expect.</p>
<p>Currently NAME is restricted to simple identifiers only.
In other words, it must match <pre>
<span class="q">/^[_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\z/</span></code>
 or
its Unicode extension (see <a href="utf8.html">utf8</a>),
though it isn't extended by the locale (see <a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a>).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to make things easier for programmers with experience
with the Python or PCRE regex engines, the pattern <code class="inline">(?P&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)</code>
may be used instead of <code class="inline">(?&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)</code>; however this form does not
support the use of single quotes as a delimiter for the name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%5ck%3cNAME%3e"></a><strong><pre>
\<span class="w">k</span><span class="q">&lt;NAME&gt;</span></code>
</strong>
</li>
<li><a id="%5ck'NAME'"></a><strong><code class="inline">\k'NAME'</code></strong>
<p>Named backreference. Similar to numeric backreferences, except that
the group is designated by name and not number. If multiple groups
have the same name then it refers to the leftmost defined group in
the current match.</p>
<p>It is an error to refer to a name not defined by a <code class="inline">(?&lt;NAME&gt;)</code>
earlier in the pattern.</p>
<p>Both forms are equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to make things easier for programmers with experience
with the Python or PCRE regex engines, the pattern <code class="inline">(?P=NAME)</code>
may be used instead of <pre>
\<span class="w">k</span><span class="q">&lt;NAME&gt;</span></code>
.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This extended regular expression feature is considered
experimental, and may be changed without notice. Code executed that
has side effects may not perform identically from version to version
due to the effect of future optimisations in the regex engine. The
implementation of this feature was radically overhauled for the 5.18.0
release, and its behaviour in earlier versions of perl was much buggier,
especially in relation to parsing, lexical vars, scoping, recursion and
reentrancy.</p>
<p>This zero-width assertion executes any embedded Perl code.  It always
succeeds, and its return value is set as <pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
.</p>
<p>In literal patterns, the code is parsed at the same time as the
surrounding code. While within the pattern, control is passed temporarily
back to the perl parser, until the logically-balancing closing brace is
encountered. This is similar to the way that an array index expression in
a literal string is handled, for example</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">&quot;abc$array[ 1 + f(&#39;[&#39;) + g()]def&quot;</span></pre>
<p>In particular, braces do not need to be balanced:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">s/abc(?{ f(&#39;{&#39;); })/def/</span></pre>
<p>Even in a pattern that is interpolated and compiled at run-time, literal
code blocks will be compiled once, at perl compile time; the following
prints "ABCD":</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;D&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$qr</span> = <span class="q">qr/(?{ BEGIN { print &quot;A&quot; } })/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">/$foo$qr(?{ BEGIN { print &quot;B&quot; } })/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/BEGIN.html">BEGIN</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;C&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>In patterns where the text of the code is derived from run-time
information rather than appearing literally in a source code /pattern/,
the code is compiled at the same time that the pattern is compiled, and
for reasons of security, <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>
 must be in scope. This is to
stop user-supplied patterns containing code snippets from being
executable.</p>
<p>In situations where you need to enable this with <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>
, you should
also have taint checking enabled.  Better yet, use the carefully
constrained evaluation within a Safe compartment.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> for
details about both these mechanisms.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of parsing, lexical variable scope and closures,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/AAA(?{ BBB })CCC/</span></pre>
<p>behaves approximately like</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/AAA/</span> &amp;&amp; <a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="w">BBB</span> <span class="s">}</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="q">/CCC/</span></pre>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">qr/AAA(?{ BBB })CCC/</span></pre>
<p>behaves approximately like</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="q">/AAA/</span> &amp;&amp; <a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="w">BBB</span> <span class="s">}</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="q">/CCC/</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>In particular:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$i</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">$r</span> = <span class="q">qr/(?{ print $i })/</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$i</span> = <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">/$r/</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="c"># prints &quot;1&quot;</span></pre>
<p>Inside a <code class="inline">(?{...})</code> block, <pre>
<span class="i">$_</span></code>
 refers to the string the regular
expression is matching against. You can also use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pos.html">pos()</a></code> to know what is
the current position of matching within this string.</p>
<p>The code block introduces a new scope from the perspective of lexical
variable declarations, but <strong>not</strong> from the perspective of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a></code> and
similar localizing behaviours. So later code blocks within the same
pattern will still see the values which were localized in earlier blocks.
These accumulated localizations are undone either at the end of a
successful match, or if the assertion is backtracked (compare
<a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>). For example,</p>
<pre>
  <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&#39;a&#39;</span> x <span class="n">8</span><span class="sc">;</span>
  <span class="q">m&lt;</span>
     <span class="q">     (?{ $cnt = 0 })               # Initialize $cnt.</span>
     <span class="q">     (</span>
       <span class="q">       a</span>
       <span class="q">       (?{</span>
           <span class="q">           local $cnt = $cnt + 1;  # Update $cnt,</span>
                                   <span class="q">                                   # backtracking-safe.</span>
       <span class="q">       })</span>
     <span class="q">     )*</span>
     <span class="q">     aaaa</span>
     <span class="q">     (?{ $res = $cnt })            # On success copy to</span>
                                   <span class="q">                                   # non-localized location.</span>
   <span class="q">   &gt;x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>will initially increment <pre>
<span class="i">$cnt</span></code>
 up to 8; then during backtracking, its
value will be unwound back to 4, which is the value assigned to <pre>
<span class="i">$res</span></code>
.
At the end of the regex execution, $cnt will be wound back to its initial
value of 0.</p>
<p>This assertion may be used as the condition in a</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)</li></ol></div><p>switch.  If <i>not</i> used in this way, the result of evaluation of <pre>
<span class="w">code</span></code>

is put into the special variable <pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
.  This happens immediately, so
<pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
 can be used from other <code class="inline">(?{ code })</code> assertions inside the same
regular expression.</p>
<p>The assignment to <pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
 above is properly localized, so the old
value of <pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
 is restored if the assertion is backtracked; compare
<a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the special variable <pre>
<span class="i">$^N</span></code>
  is particularly useful with code
blocks to capture the results of submatches in variables without having to

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This extended regular expression feature is considered
experimental, and may be changed without notice. Code executed that
has side effects may not perform identically from version to version
due to the effect of future optimisations in the regex engine.</p>
<p>This is a "postponed" regular subexpression.  It behaves in <i>exactly</i> the
same way as a <code class="inline">(?{ code })</code> code block as described above, except that
its return value, rather than being assigned to <pre>
<span class="i">$^R</span></code>
, is treated as a
pattern, compiled if it's a string (or used as-is if its a qr// object),
then matched as if it were inserted instead of this construct.</p>
<p>During the matching of this sub-pattern, it has its own set of
captures which are valid during the sub-match, but are discarded once
control returns to the main pattern. For example, the following matches,
with the inner pattern capturing "B" and matching "BB", while the outer
pattern captures "A";</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$inner</span> = <span class="q">&#39;(.)\1&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">&quot;ABBA&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/^(.)(??{ $inner })\1/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="i">$1</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="c"># prints &quot;A&quot;;</span></pre>
<p>Note that this means that  there is no way for the inner pattern to refer
to a capture group defined outside.  (The code block itself can use <pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>
,
etc., to refer to the enclosing pattern's capture groups.)  Thus, although</p>
<pre>
    <span class="s">(</span><span class="q">&#39;a&#39;</span> x <span class="n">100</span><span class="s">)</span>=~<span class="q">/(??{&#39;(.)&#39; x 100})/</span></pre>
<p><i>will</i> match, it will <i>not</i> set $1 on exit.</p>
<p>The following pattern matches a parenthesized group:</p>
<pre>
 <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">qr{</span>
            <span class="q">            \(</span>
            <span class="q">            (?:</span>
               <span class="q">               (?&gt; [^()]+ )  # Non-parens without backtracking</span>
             <span class="q">             |</span>
               <span class="q">               (??{ $re })   # Group with matching parens</span>
            <span class="q">            )*</span>
            <span class="q">            \)</span>

 except that it does not involve executing any
code or potentially compiling a returned pattern string; instead it treats
the part of the current pattern contained within a specified capture group
as an independent pattern that must match at the current position.
Capture groups contained by the pattern will have the value as determined
by the outermost recursion.</p>
<p><i>PARNO</i> is a sequence of digits (not starting with 0) whose value reflects
the paren-number of the capture group to recurse to. <code class="inline">(?R)</code> recurses to
the beginning of the whole pattern. <code class="inline">(?0)</code> is an alternate syntax for
<code class="inline">(?R)</code>. If <i>PARNO</i> is preceded by a plus or minus sign then it is assumed
to be relative, with negative numbers indicating preceding capture groups
and positive ones following. Thus <code class="inline">(?-1)</code> refers to the most recently
declared group, and <code class="inline">(?+1)</code> indicates the next group to be declared.
Note that the counting for relative recursion differs from that of
relative backreferences, in that with recursion unclosed groups <strong>are</strong>
included.</p>

<p>The following shows how using negative indexing can make it
easier to embed recursive patterns inside of a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr//</a></code> construct

    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that this pattern does not behave the same way as the equivalent
PCRE or Python construct of the same form. In Perl you can backtrack into
a recursed group, in PCRE and Python the recursed into group is treated
as atomic. Also, modifiers are resolved at compile time, so constructs
like (?i:(?1)) or (?:(?i)(?1)) do not affect how the sub-pattern will
be processed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%26NAME)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?&amp;NAME)</code>

<p>Recurse to a named subpattern. Identical to <code class="inline">(?<i>PARNO</i>)</code> except that the
parenthesis to recurse to is determined by name. If multiple parentheses have
the same name, then it recurses to the leftmost.</p>
<p>It is an error to refer to a name that is not declared somewhere in the
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to make things easier for programmers with experience
with the Python or PCRE regex engines the pattern <code class="inline">(?P&gt;NAME)</code>
may be used instead of <code class="inline">(?&amp;NAME)</code>.</p>

<p>Conditional expression. Matches <pre>

<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">condition</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 should be one of: 1) an integer in
parentheses (which is valid if the corresponding pair of parentheses
matched); 2) a look-ahead/look-behind/evaluate zero-width assertion; 3) a
name in angle brackets or single quotes (which is valid if a group
with the given name matched); or 4) the special symbol (R) (true when
evaluated inside of recursion or eval). Additionally the R may be
followed by a number, (which will be true when evaluated when recursing
inside of the appropriate group), or by <pre>
<span class="i">&amp;NAME</span></code>
, in which case it will
be true only when evaluated during recursion in the named group.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the possible predicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="(1)-(2)-..."></a><strong>(1) (2) ...</strong>
<p>Checks if the numbered capturing group has matched something.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3cNAME%3e)-('NAME')"></a><strong>(&lt;NAME&gt;) ('NAME')</strong>
<p>Checks if a group with the given name has matched something.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%3d...)-(%3f!...)-(%3f%3c%3d...)-(%3f%3c!...)"></a><strong>(?=...) (?!...) (?&lt;=...) (?&lt;!...)</strong>
<p>Checks whether the pattern matches (or does not match, for the '!'
variants).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%7b-CODE-%7d)"></a><strong>(?{ CODE })</strong>
<p>Treats the return value of the code block as the condition.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(R)"></a><strong>(R)</strong>
<p>Checks if the expression has been evaluated inside of recursion.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(R1)-(R2)-..."></a><strong>(R1) (R2) ...</strong>
<p>Checks if the expression has been evaluated while executing directly
inside of the n-th capture group. This check is the regex equivalent of</p>
<pre>
  <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/caller.html">caller</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="s">)</span>[<span class="n">3</span>] <a class="l_k" href="functions/eq.html">eq</a> <span class="q">&#39;subname&#39;</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> ... <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>In other words, it does not check the full recursion stack.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(R%26NAME)"></a><strong>(R&amp;NAME)</strong>
<p>Similar to <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">R1</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, this predicate checks to see if we're executing
directly inside of the leftmost group with a given name (this is the same
logic used by <code class="inline">(?&amp;NAME)</code> to disambiguate). It does not check the full
stack, but only the name of the innermost active recursion.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(DEFINE)"></a><strong>(DEFINE)</strong>
<p>In this case, the yes-pattern is never directly executed, and no
no-pattern is allowed. Similar in spirit to <code class="inline">(?{0})</code> but more efficient.
See below for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">m{ ( \( )?</span>
       <span class="q">       [^()]+</span>
       <span class="q">       (?(1) \) )</span>
     <span class="q">     }x</span></pre>
<p>matches a chunk of non-parentheses, possibly included in parentheses
themselves.</p>
<p>A special form is the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">DEFINE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 predicate, which never executes its
yes-pattern directly, and does not allow a no-pattern. This allows one to
define subpatterns which will be executed only by the recursion mechanism.
This way, you can define a set of regular expression rules that can be
bundled into any pattern you choose.</p>
<p>It is recommended that for this usage you put the DEFINE block at the
end of the pattern, and that you name any subpatterns defined within it.</p>
<p>Also, it's worth noting that patterns defined this way probably will
not be as efficient, as the optimiser is not very clever about
handling them.</p>
<p>An example of how this might be used is as follows:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/(?&lt;NAME&gt;(?&amp;NAME_PAT))(?&lt;ADDR&gt;(?&amp;ADDRESS_PAT))</span>
   <span class="q">   (?(DEFINE)</span>
     <span class="q">     (?&lt;NAME_PAT&gt;....)</span>
     <span class="q">     (?&lt;ADRESS_PAT&gt;....)</span>
   <span class="q">   )/x</span></pre>
<p>Note that capture groups matched inside of recursion are not accessible
after the recursion returns, so the extra layer of capturing groups is
necessary. Thus <pre>
<span class="i">$+</span>{<span class="w">NAME_PAT</span>}</code>
 would not be defined even though
<pre>
<span class="i">$+</span>{<span class="w">NAME</span>}</code>
 would be.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that subpatterns created inside a DEFINE block
count towards the absolute and relative number of captures, so this:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">@captures</span> = <span class="q">&quot;a&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/(.)                  # First capture</span>
                           <span class="q">                           (?(DEFINE)</span>
                               <span class="q">                               (?&lt;EXAMPLE&gt; 1 )  # Second capture</span>
                           <span class="q">                           )/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/say.html">say</a> <a class="l_k" href="functions/scalar.html">scalar</a> <span class="i">@captures</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Will output 2, not 1. This is particularly important if you intend to
compile the definitions with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr//</a></code> operator, and later
interpolate them in another pattern.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%3epattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code>
   </strong>
<p>An "independent" subexpression, one which matches the substring
that a <i>standalone</i> <pre>
<span class="w">pattern</span></code>
 would match if anchored at the given
position, and it matches <i>nothing other than this substring</i>.  This
construct is useful for optimizations of what would otherwise be
"eternal" matches, because it will not backtrack (see <a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>).
It may also be useful in places where the "grab all you can, and do not
give anything back" semantic is desirable.</p>
<p>For example: <code class="inline">^(?&gt;a*)ab</code> will never match, since <code class="inline">(?&gt;a*)</code>
(anchored at the beginning of string, as above) will match <i>all</i>
characters <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
 at the beginning of string, leaving no <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
 for
<pre>
<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 to match.  In contrast, <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>*<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 will match the same as <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>+<span class="w">b</span></code>
,
since the match of the subgroup <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>*</code>
 is influenced by the following
group <pre>
<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 (see <a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>).  In particular, <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>*</code>
 inside
<pre>
<span class="w">a</span>*<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 will match fewer characters than a standalone <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>*</code>
, since
this makes the tail match.</p>
<p><code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code> does not disable backtracking altogether once it has
matched. It is still possible to backtrack past the construct, but not
into it. So <code class="inline">((?&gt;a*)|(?&gt;b*))ar</code> will still match "bar".</p>
<p>An effect similar to <code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code> may be achieved by writing
<code class="inline">(?=(pattern))\g{-1}</code>.  This matches the same substring as a standalone
<pre>
<span class="w">a</span>+</code>
, and the following <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">-1</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 eats the matched string; it therefore
makes a zero-length assertion into an analogue of <code class="inline">(?&gt;...)</code>.
(The difference between these two constructs is that the second one
uses a capturing group, thus shifting ordinals of backreferences
in the rest of a regular expression.)</p>
<p>Consider this pattern:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">m{ \(</span>
          <span class="q">          (</span>
            <span class="q">            [^()]+           # x+</span>
          <span class="q">          |</span>
            <span class="q">            \( [^()]* \)</span>
          <span class="q">          )+</span>
       <span class="q">       \)</span>
     <span class="q">     }x</span></pre>
<p>That will efficiently match a nonempty group with matching parentheses
two levels deep or less.  However, if there is no such group, it
will take virtually forever on a long string.  That's because there
are so many different ways to split a long string into several
substrings.  This is what <code class="inline">(.+)+</code> is doing, and <code class="inline">(.+)+</code> is similar
to a subpattern of the above pattern.  Consider how the pattern
above detects no-match on <code class="inline">((()aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> in several
seconds, but that each extra letter doubles this time.  This
exponential performance will make it appear that your program has
hung.  However, a tiny change to this pattern</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">m{ \(</span>
          <span class="q">          (</span>
            <span class="q">            (?&gt; [^()]+ )        # change x+ above to (?&gt; x+ )</span>
          <span class="q">          |</span>
            <span class="q">            \( [^()]* \)</span>
          <span class="q">          )+</span>
       <span class="q">       \)</span>
     <span class="q">     }x</span></pre>
<p>which uses <code class="inline">(?&gt;...)</code> matches exactly when the one above does (verifying
this yourself would be a productive exercise), but finishes in a fourth
the time when used on a similar string with 1000000 <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
s.  Be aware,
however, that, when this construct is followed by a
quantifier, it currently triggers a warning message under
the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or <strong>-w</strong> switch saying it
<pre>
<span class="q">&quot;matches null string many times in regex&quot;</span></code>
.</p>
<p>On simple groups, such as the pattern <code class="inline">(?&gt; [^()]+ )</code>, a comparable
effect may be achieved by negative look-ahead, as in <code class="inline">[^()]+ (?! [^()] )</code>.
This was only 4 times slower on a string with 1000000 <pre>
<span class="w">a</span></code>
s.</p>
<p>The "grab all you can, and do not give anything back" semantic is desirable
in many situations where on the first sight a simple <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>*</code>
 looks like
the correct solution.  Suppose we parse text with comments being delimited
by <pre>
<span class="c">#</span></code>
 followed by some optional (horizontal) whitespace.  Contrary to
its appearance, <pre>
<span class="c">#[ \t]*</span></code>
 <i>is not</i> the correct subexpression to match
the comment delimiter, because it may "give up" some whitespace if
the remainder of the pattern can be made to match that way.  The correct
answer is either one of these:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?&gt;#[ \t]*)</span>
    <span class="q">    #[ \t]*(?</span>!<span class="s">[</span> \<span class="w">t</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>For example, to grab non-empty comments into $1, one should use either
one of these:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/ (?&gt; \# [ \t]* ) (        .+ ) /x</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">/     \# [ \t]*   ( [^ \t] .* ) /x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Which one you pick depends on which of these expressions better reflects
the above specification of comments.</p>
<p>In some literature this construct is called "atomic matching" or
"possessive matching".</p>

<a id="Special-Backtracking-Control-Verbs"></a><h3 class='h3' >Special Backtracking Control Verbs</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> These patterns are experimental and subject to change or
removal in a future version of Perl. Their usage in production code should
be noted to avoid problems during upgrades.</p>
<p>These special patterns are generally of the form <code class="inline">(*VERB:ARG)</code>. Unless
otherwise stated the ARG argument is optional; in some cases, it is
forbidden.</p>
<p>Any pattern containing a special backtracking verb that allows an argument
has the special behaviour that when executed it sets the current package's
<pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 variables. When doing so the following
rules apply:</p>
<p>On failure, the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 variable will be set to the ARG value of the
verb pattern, if the verb was involved in the failure of the match. If the
ARG part of the pattern was omitted, then <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 will be set to the
name of the last <code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> pattern executed, or to TRUE if there was
none. Also, the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 variable will be set to FALSE.</p>
<p>On a successful match, the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 variable will be set to FALSE, and
the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 variable will be set to the name of the last
<code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> pattern executed.  See the explanation for the
<code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> verb below for more details.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 are not magic variables like <pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>

and most other regex-related variables. They are not local to a scope, nor
readonly, but instead are volatile package variables similar to <pre>
<span class="i">$AUTOLOAD</span></code>
.
Use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a></code> to localize changes to them to a specific scope if necessary.</p>
<p>If a pattern does not contain a special backtracking verb that allows an
argument, then <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 are not touched at all.</p>

<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 <code class="inline">(*PRUNE:NAME)</code>
 </strong>
<p>This zero-width pattern prunes the backtracking tree at the current point
when backtracked into on failure. Consider the pattern <code class="inline">A (*PRUNE) B</code>,
where A and B are complex patterns. Until the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 verb is reached,
A may backtrack as necessary to match. Once it is reached, matching
continues in B, which may also backtrack as necessary; however, should B
not match, then no further backtracking will take place, and the pattern
will fail outright at the current starting position.</p>
<p>The following example counts all the possible matching strings in a
pattern (without actually matching any of them).</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">&#39;aaab&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/a+b?(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Count=$count\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>which produces:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">aaab</span>
    <span class="w">aaa</span>
    <span class="w">aa</span>
    <span class="w">a</span>
    <span class="w">aab</span>
    <span class="w">aa</span>
    <span class="w">a</span>
    <span class="w">ab</span>
    <span class="w">a</span>
    <span class="w">Count</span>=<span class="n">9</span></pre>
<p>If we add a <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 before the count like the following</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">&#39;aaab&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/a+b?(*PRUNE)(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Count=$count\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>we prevent backtracking and find the count of the longest matching string
at each matching starting point like so:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">aaab</span>
    <span class="w">aab</span>
    <span class="w">ab</span>
    <span class="w">Count</span>=<span class="n">3</span></pre>
<p>Any number of <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 assertions may be used in a pattern.</p>
<p>See also <code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code> and possessive quantifiers for other ways to
control backtracking. In some cases, the use of <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 can be
replaced with a <code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code> with no functional difference; however,
<pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 can be used to handle cases that cannot be expressed using a
<code class="inline">(?&gt;pattern)</code> alone.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(*SKIP)-(*SKIP%3aNAME)"></a><strong><pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 <code class="inline">(*SKIP:NAME)</code>
</strong>
<p>This zero-width pattern is similar to <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, except that on
failure it also signifies that whatever text that was matched leading up
to the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 pattern being executed cannot be part of <i>any</i> match
of this pattern. This effectively means that the regex engine "skips" forward
to this position on failure and tries to match again, (assuming that
there is sufficient room to match).</p>
<p>The name of the <code class="inline">(*SKIP:NAME)</code> pattern has special significance. If a
<code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> was encountered while matching, then it is that position
which is used as the "skip point". If no <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*MARK</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 of that name was
encountered, then the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 operator has no effect. When used
without a name the "skip point" is where the match point was when
executing the (*SKIP) pattern.</p>
<p>Compare the following to the examples in <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
; note the string
is twice as long:</p>
<pre>
 <span class="q">&#39;aaabaaab&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/a+b?(*SKIP)(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
 <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Count=$count\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">aaab</span>
    <span class="w">aaab</span>
    <span class="w">Count</span>=<span class="n">2</span></pre>
<p>Once the 'aaab' at the start of the string has matched, and the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

executed, the next starting point will be where the cursor was when the
<pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 was executed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(*MARK%3aNAME)-(*%3aNAME)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> <code class="inline">(*:NAME)</code>
  </strong>
<p>This zero-width pattern can be used to mark the point reached in a string
when a certain part of the pattern has been successfully matched. This
mark may be given a name. A later <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 pattern will then skip
forward to that point if backtracked into on failure. Any number of
<pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*MARK</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 patterns are allowed, and the NAME portion may be duplicated.</p>
<p>In addition to interacting with the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 pattern, <code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code>
can be used to "label" a pattern branch, so that after matching, the
program can determine which branches of the pattern were involved in the
match.</p>
<p>When a match is successful, the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGMARK</span></code>
 variable will be set to the
name of the most recently executed <code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> that was involved
in the match.</p>
<p>This can be used to determine which branch of a pattern was matched
without using a separate capture group for each branch, which in turn
can result in a performance improvement, as perl cannot optimize
<pre>
<span class="q">/(?:(x)|(y)|(z))/</span></code>
 as efficiently as something like
<pre>
<span class="q">/(?:x(*MARK:x)|y(*MARK:y)|z(*MARK:z))/</span></code>
.</p>
<p>When a match has failed, and unless another verb has been involved in
failing the match and has provided its own name to use, the <pre>
<span class="i">$REGERROR</span></code>

variable will be set to the name of the most recently executed
<code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="#(*SKIP)">(*SKIP)</a> for more details.</p>
<p>As a shortcut <code class="inline">(*MARK:NAME)</code> can be written <code class="inline">(*:NAME)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(*THEN)-(*THEN%3aNAME)"></a><strong><pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*THEN</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 <code class="inline">(*THEN:NAME)</code></strong>
<p>This is similar to the "cut group" operator <pre>
<span class="w">::</span></code>
 from Perl 6.  Like
<pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, this verb always matches, and when backtracked into on
failure, it causes the regex engine to try the next alternation in the
innermost enclosing group (capturing or otherwise) that has alternations.
The two branches of a <code class="inline">(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)</code> do not
count as an alternation, as far as <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*THEN</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 is concerned.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the observation that this operation combined with the
alternation operator (<code class="inline">|</code>) can be used to create what is essentially a
pattern-based if/then/else block:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>  ( COND (*THEN) FOO | COND2 (*THEN) BAR | COND3 (*THEN) BAZ )</li></ol></div><p>Note that if this operator is used and NOT inside of an alternation then
it acts exactly like the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 operator.</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/ A (*PRUNE) B /</span></pre>
<p>is the same as</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/ A (*THEN) B /</span></pre>
<p>but</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/ ( A (*THEN) B | C ) /</span></pre>
<p>is not the same as</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">/ ( A (*PRUNE) B | C ) /</span></pre>
<p>as after matching the A but failing on the B the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*THEN</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 verb will
backtrack and try C; but the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*PRUNE</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 verb will simply fail.</p>

<ul>
<li><a id="(*COMMIT)"></a><strong><pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*COMMIT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

</strong>
<p>This is the Perl 6 "commit pattern" <pre>
<span class="q">&lt;commit&gt;</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">:::</code>. It's a
zero-width pattern similar to <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*SKIP</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, except that when backtracked
into on failure it causes the match to fail outright. No further attempts
to find a valid match by advancing the start pointer will occur again.
For example,</p>
<pre>
 <span class="q">&#39;aaabaaab&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/a+b?(*COMMIT)(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
 <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Count=$count\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">aaab</span>
    <span class="w">Count</span>=<span class="n">1</span></pre>
<p>In other words, once the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*COMMIT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

does not match, the regex engine will not try any further matching on the
rest of the string.</p>

 <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*F</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

 </strong>
<p>This pattern matches nothing and always fails. It can be used to force the
engine to backtrack. It is equivalent to <code class="inline">(?!)</code>, but easier to read. In
fact, <code class="inline">(?!)</code> gets optimised into <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*FAIL</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 internally.</p>
<p>It is probably useful only when combined with <code class="inline">(?{})</code> or <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="q">??</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(*ACCEPT)"></a><strong><pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*ACCEPT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

</strong>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This feature is highly experimental. It is not recommended
for production code.</p>
<p>This pattern matches nothing and causes the end of successful matching at
the point at which the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*ACCEPT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 pattern was encountered, regardless of
whether there is actually more to match in the string. When inside of a
nested pattern, such as recursion, or in a subpattern dynamically generated
via <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="q">??</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, only the innermost pattern is ended immediately.</p>
<p>If the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*ACCEPT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 is inside of capturing groups then the groups are
marked as ended at the point at which the <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">*ACCEPT</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 was encountered.
For instance:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="q">&#39;AB&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/(A (A|B(*ACCEPT)|C) D)(E)/x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>will match, and <pre>
<span class="i">$1</span></code>
 will be <pre>
<span class="w">AB</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="i">$2</span></code>
 will be <pre>
<span class="w">B</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">$3</span></code>
 will not
be set. If another branch in the inner parentheses was matched, such as in the
string 'ACDE', then the <pre>
<span class="w">D</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">E</span></code>
 would have to be matched as well.</p>

<a id="Backtracking"></a><h3 class='h3' >Backtracking
 </h3>
<p>NOTE: This section presents an abstract approximation of regular
expression behavior.  For a more rigorous (and complicated) view of
the rules involved in selecting a match among possible alternatives,
see <a href="#Combining-RE-Pieces">Combining RE Pieces</a>.</p>
<p>A fundamental feature of regular expression matching involves the
notion called <i>backtracking</i>, which is currently used (when needed)
by all regular non-possessive expression quantifiers, namely <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">*?</span></code>
, <pre>
+</code>
,
<code class="inline">+?</code>, <code class="inline">{n,m}</code>, and <code class="inline">{n,m}?</code>.  Backtracking is often optimized
internally, but the general principle outlined here is valid.</p>
<p>For a regular expression to match, the <i>entire</i> regular expression must
match, not just part of it.  So if the beginning of a pattern containing a
quantifier succeeds in a way that causes later parts in the pattern to
fail, the matching engine backs up and recalculates the beginning
part--that's why it's called backtracking.</p>
<p>Here is an example of backtracking:  Let's say you want to find the
word following "foo" in the string "Food is on the foo table.":</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&quot;Food is on the foo table.&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/\b(foo)\s+(\w+)/i</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;$2 follows $1.\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>When the match runs, the first part of the regular expression (<pre>
\<span class="i">b</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
)
finds a possible match right at the beginning of the string, and loads up
$1 with "Foo".  However, as soon as the matching engine sees that there's
no whitespace following the "Foo" that it had saved in $1, it realizes its
mistake and starts over again one character after where it had the
tentative match.  This time it goes all the way until the next occurrence
of "foo". The complete regular expression matches this time, and you get
the expected output of "table follows foo."</p>
<p>Sometimes minimal matching can help a lot.  Imagine you'd like to match
everything between "foo" and "bar".  Initially, you write something
like this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> =  <span class="q">&quot;The food is under the bar in the barn.&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/foo(.*)bar/</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;got &lt;$1&gt;\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>Which perhaps unexpectedly yields:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="w">got</span> <span class="q">&lt;d is under the bar in the &gt;</span></pre>
<p>That's because <code class="inline">.*</code> was greedy, so you get everything between the
<i>first</i> "foo" and the <i>last</i> "bar".  Here it's more effective
to use minimal matching to make sure you get the text between a "foo"
and the first "bar" thereafter.</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/foo(.*?)bar/</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;got &lt;$1&gt;\n&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span>
  <span class="w">got</span> <span class="q">&lt;d is under the &gt;</span></pre>
<p>Here's another example. Let's say you'd like to match a number at the end
of a string, and you also want to keep the preceding part of the match.
So you write this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&quot;I have 2 numbers: 53147&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/(.*)(\d*)/</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>                                <span class="c"># Wrong!</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Beginning is &lt;$1&gt;, number is &lt;$2&gt;.\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>That won't work at all, because <code class="inline">.*</code> was greedy and gobbled up the
whole string. As <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span>*</code>
 can match on an empty string the complete
regular expression matched successfully.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">Beginning</span> <span class="w">is</span> <span class="q">&lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="w">number</span> <span class="w">is</span> &lt;&gt;.</pre>
<p>Here are some variants, most of which don't work:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&quot;I have 2 numbers: 53147&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">@pats</span> = <span class="q">qw{</span>

<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (.*)(\d*)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt; &lt;&gt;</li><li>    (.*)(\d+)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;</li><li>    (.*?)(\d*)   &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;</li><li>    (.*?)(\d+)   &lt;I have &gt; &lt;2&gt;</li><li>    (.*)(\d+)$   &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;</li><li>    (.*?)(\d+)$  &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;</li><li>    (.*)\b(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;</li><li>    (.*\D)(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;</li></ol></div><p>As you see, this can be a bit tricky.  It's important to realize that a
regular expression is merely a set of assertions that gives a definition
of success.  There may be 0, 1, or several different ways that the
definition might succeed against a particular string.  And if there are
multiple ways it might succeed, you need to understand backtracking to
know which variety of success you will achieve.</p>
<p>When using look-ahead assertions and negations, this can all get even
trickier.  Imagine you'd like to find a sequence of non-digits not
followed by "123".  You might try to write that as</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&quot;ABC123&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">/^\D*(?!123)/</span> <span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>                <span class="c"># Wrong!</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;Yup, no 123 in $_\n&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>But that isn't going to match; at least, not the way you're hoping.  It
claims that there is no 123 in the string.  Here's a clearer picture of
why that pattern matches, contrary to popular expectations:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$x</span> = <span class="q">&#39;ABC123&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$y</span> = <span class="q">&#39;ABC445&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>

    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;1: got $1\n&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="i">$x</span> =~ <span class="q">/^(ABC)(?!123)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;2: got $1\n&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="i">$y</span> =~ <span class="q">/^(ABC)(?!123)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>

    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;3: got $1\n&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="i">$x</span> =~ <span class="q">/^(\D*)(?!123)/</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;4: got $1\n&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="i">$y</span> =~ <span class="q">/^(\D*)(?!123)/</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>This prints</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    2: got ABC</li><li>    3: got AB</li><li>    4: got ABC</li></ol></div><p>You might have expected test 3 to fail because it seems to a more
general purpose version of test 1.  The important difference between
them is that test 3 contains a quantifier (<pre>
\<span class="w">D</span>*</code>
) and so can use
backtracking, whereas test 1 will not.  What's happening is
that you've asked "Is it true that at the start of $x, following 0 or more
non-digits, you have something that's not 123?"  If the pattern matcher had
let <pre>
\<span class="w">D</span>*</code>
 expand to "ABC", this would have caused the whole pattern to
fail.</p>
<p>The search engine will initially match <pre>
\<span class="w">D</span>*</code>
 with "ABC".  Then it will
try to match <code class="inline">(?!123)</code> with "123", which fails.  But because
a quantifier (<pre>
\<span class="w">D</span>*</code>
) has been used in the regular expression, the
search engine can backtrack and retry the match differently
in the hope of matching the complete regular expression.</p>
<p>The pattern really, <i>really</i> wants to succeed, so it uses the
standard pattern back-off-and-retry and lets <pre>
\<span class="w">D</span>*</code>
 expand to just "AB" this
time.  Now there's indeed something following "AB" that is not
"123".  It's "C123", which suffices.</p>
<p>We can deal with this by using both an assertion and a negation.
We'll say that the first part in $1 must be followed both by a digit
and by something that's not "123".  Remember that the look-aheads
are zero-width expressions--they only look, but don't consume any
of the string in their match.  So rewriting this way produces what
you'd expect; that is, case 5 will fail, but case 6 succeeds:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    print "5: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;</li><li>    print "6: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;</li><li></li><li>    6: got ABC</li></ol></div><p>In other words, the two zero-width assertions next to each other work as though
they're ANDed together, just as you'd use any built-in assertions:  <pre>
<span class="q">/^$/</span></code>

matches only if you're at the beginning of the line AND the end of the
line simultaneously.  The deeper underlying truth is that juxtaposition in
regular expressions always means AND, except when you write an explicit OR
using the vertical bar.  <pre>
<span class="q">/ab/</span></code>
 means match "a" AND (then) match "b",
although the attempted matches are made at different positions because "a"
is not a zero-width assertion, but a one-width assertion.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Particularly complicated regular expressions can take
exponential time to solve because of the immense number of possible
ways they can use backtracking to try for a match.  For example, without
internal optimizations done by the regular expression engine, this will
take a painfully long time to run:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">&#39;aaaaaaaaaaaa&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">/((a{0,5}){0,5})*[c]/</span></pre>
<p>And if you used <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
's in the internal groups instead of limiting them
to 0 through 5 matches, then it would take forever--or until you ran
out of stack space.  Moreover, these internal optimizations are not
always applicable.  For example, if you put <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 instead of <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>

on the external group, no current optimization is applicable, and the
match takes a long time to finish.</p>
<p>A powerful tool for optimizing such beasts is what is known as an
"independent group",
which does not backtrack (see <a href="#(%3f%3epattern)">(?&gt;pattern)</a>).  Note also that
zero-length look-ahead/look-behind assertions will not backtrack to make
the tail match, since they are in "logical" context: only
whether they match is considered relevant.  For an example
where side-effects of look-ahead <i>might</i> have influenced the
following match, see <a href="#(%3f%3epattern)">(?&gt;pattern)</a>.</p>
<a id="Version-8-Regular-Expressions"></a><h3 class='h3' >Version 8 Regular Expressions
  </h3>
<p>In case you're not familiar with the "regular" Version 8 regex
routines, here are the pattern-matching rules not described above.</p>
<p>Any single character matches itself, unless it is a <i>metacharacter</i>
with a special meaning described here or above.  You can cause
characters that normally function as metacharacters to be interpreted
literally by prefixing them with a "\" (e.g., "\." matches a ".", not any
character; "\\" matches a "\"). This escape mechanism is also required
for the character used as the pattern delimiter.</p>
<p>A series of characters matches that series of characters in the target
string, so the pattern <pre>
<span class="w">blurfl</span></code>
 would match "blurfl" in the target
string.</p>
<p>You can specify a character class, by enclosing a list of characters
in <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
, which will match any character from the list.  If the
first character after the "[" is "^", the class matches any character not
in the list.  Within a list, the "-" character specifies a
range, so that <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>-z</code>
 represents all characters between "a" and "z",
inclusive.  If you want either "-" or "]" itself to be a member of a
class, put it at the start of the list (possibly after a "^"), or
escape it with a backslash.  "-" is also taken literally when it is
at the end of the list, just before the closing "]".  (The
following all specify the same class of three characters: <pre>
<span class="s">[</span>-<span class="w">az</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
,
<pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">az</span>-<span class="s">]</span></code>
, and <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>\-z<span class="s">]</span></code>
.  All are different from <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>-z<span class="s">]</span></code>
, which
specifies a class containing twenty-six characters, even on EBCDIC-based
character sets.)  Also, if you try to use the character
classes <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">W</span></code>
, <code class="inline">\s</code>, <pre>
\<span class="w">S</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
, or <pre>
\<span class="w">D</span></code>
 as endpoints of
a range, the "-" is understood literally.</p>
<p>Note also that the whole range idea is rather unportable between
character sets--and even within character sets they may cause results
you probably didn't expect.  A sound principle is to use only ranges
that begin from and end at either alphabetics of equal case ([a-e],
[A-E]), or digits ([0-9]).  Anything else is unsafe.  If in doubt,
spell out the character sets in full.</p>
<p>Characters may be specified using a metacharacter syntax much like that
used in C: "\n" matches a newline, "\t" a tab, "\r" a carriage return,
"\f" a form feed, etc.  More generally, \<i>nnn</i>, where <i>nnn</i> is a string
of three octal digits, matches the character whose coded character set value
is <i>nnn</i>.  Similarly, \x<i>nn</i>, where <i>nn</i> are hexadecimal digits,
matches the character whose ordinal is <i>nn</i>. The expression \c<i>x</i>
matches the character control-<i>x</i>.  Finally, the "." metacharacter
matches any character except "\n" (unless you use <code class="inline">/s</code>).</p>
<p>You can specify a series of alternatives for a pattern using "|" to
separate them, so that <pre>
<span class="w">fee</span>|<span class="w">fie</span>|<span class="w">foe</span></code>
 will match any of "fee", "fie",
or "foe" in the target string (as would <code class="inline">f(e|i|o)e</code>).  The
first alternative includes everything from the last pattern delimiter
("(", "(?:", etc. or the beginning of the pattern) up to the first "|", and
the last alternative contains everything from the last "|" to the next
closing pattern delimiter.  That's why it's common practice to include
alternatives in parentheses: to minimize confusion about where they
start and end.</p>
<p>Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first
alternative found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that
is chosen. This means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For
example: when matching <pre>
<span class="w">foo</span>|<span class="w">foot</span></code>
 against "barefoot", only the "foo"
part will match, as that is the first alternative tried, and it successfully
matches the target string. (This might not seem important, but it is
important when you are capturing matched text using parentheses.)</p>
<p>Also remember that "|" is interpreted as a literal within square brackets,
so if you write <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">fee</span>|<span class="w">fie</span>|<span class="w">foe</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
 you're really only matching <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">feio</span>|<span class="s">]</span></code>
.</p>
<p>Within a pattern, you may designate subpatterns for later reference
by enclosing them in parentheses, and you may refer back to the
<i>n</i>th subpattern later in the pattern using the metacharacter
\<i>n</i> or \g<i>n</i>.  Subpatterns are numbered based on the left to right order
of their opening parenthesis.  A backreference matches whatever
actually matched the subpattern in the string being examined, not
the rules for that subpattern.  Therefore, <code class="inline">(0|0x)\d*\s\g1\d*</code> will
match "0x1234 0x4321", but not "0x1234 01234", because subpattern
1 matched "0x", even though the rule <pre>
<span class="n">0</span>|<span class="n">0</span>x</code>
 could potentially match
the leading 0 in the second number.</p>
<a id="Warning-on-%5c1-Instead-of-%241"></a><h3 class='h3' >Warning on \1 Instead of $1</h3>
<p>Some people get too used to writing things like:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$pattern</span> =~ <span class="q">s/(\W)/\\\1/g</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>This is grandfathered (for \1 to \9) for the RHS of a substitute to avoid
shocking the
<strong>sed</strong> addicts, but it's a dirty habit to get into.  That's because in
PerlThink, the righthand side of an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code> is a double-quoted string.  <pre>
\<span class="n">1</span></code>
 in
the usual double-quoted string means a control-A.  The customary Unix
meaning of <pre>
\<span class="n">1</span></code>
 is kludged in for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code>.  However, if you get into the habit
of doing that, you get yourself into trouble if you then add an <code class="inline">/e</code>
modifier.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">s/(\d+)/ \1 + 1 /eg</span><span class="sc">;</span>            <span class="c"># causes warning under -w</span></pre>
<p>Or if you try to do</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">s/(\d+)/\1000/</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>You can't disambiguate that by saying <pre>
\<span class="s">{</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="n">000</span></code>
, whereas you can fix it with
<code class="inline">${1}000</code>.  The operation of interpolation should not be confused
with the operation of matching a backreference.  Certainly they mean two
different things on the <i>left</i> side of the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code>.</p>
<a id="Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring"></a><h3 class='h3' >Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Difficult material (and prose) ahead.  This section needs a rewrite.</p>
<p>Regular expressions provide a terse and powerful programming language.  As
with most other power tools, power comes together with the ability
to wreak havoc.</p>
<p>A common abuse of this power stems from the ability to make infinite
loops using regular expressions, with something as innocuous as:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">&#39;foo&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">m{ ( o? )* }x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">o?</code> matches at the beginning of <pre>
<span class="q">&#39;foo&#39;</span></code>
, and since the position
in the string is not moved by the match, <code class="inline">o?</code> would match again and again
because of the <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
 quantifier.  Another common way to create a similar cycle
is with the looping modifier <pre>
<span class="q">//g</span></code>
:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@matches</span> = <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">&#39;foo&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">m{ o? }xg</span> <span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;match: &lt;$&amp;&gt;\n&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/while.html">while</a> <span class="q">&#39;foo&#39;</span> =~ <span class="q">m{ o? }xg</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>or the loop implied by split().</p>
<p>However, long experience has shown that many programming tasks may
be significantly simplified by using repeated subexpressions that
may match zero-length substrings.  Here's a simple example being:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@chars</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a> <span class="q">//</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$string</span><span class="sc">;</span>           <span class="c"># // is not magic in split</span>
    <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$whitewashed</span> = <span class="i">$string</span><span class="s">)</span> =~ <span class="q">s/()/ /g</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="c"># parens avoid magic s// /</span></pre>
<p>Thus Perl allows such constructs, by <i>forcefully breaking
the infinite loop</i>.  The rules for this are different for lower-level
loops given by the greedy quantifiers <pre>
<span class="i">*+</span>{}</code>
, and for higher-level
ones like the <code class="inline">/g</code> modifier or split() operator.</p>
<p>The lower-level loops are <i>interrupted</i> (that is, the loop is
broken) when Perl detects that a repeated expression matched a
zero-length substring.   Thus</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH | ZERO_LENGTH )* }x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>is made equivalent to</p>
<pre>
   <span class="q">m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH )* (?: ZERO_LENGTH )? }x</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>For example, this program</p>
<pre>
   <span class="c">#!perl -l</span>
   <span class="q">&quot;aaaaab&quot;</span> =~ <span class="q">/</span>
     <span class="q">     (?:</span>
        <span class="q">        a                 # non-zero</span>
        <span class="q">        |                 # or</span>
       <span class="q">       (?{print &quot;hello&quot;}) # print hello whenever this</span>
                          <span class="q">                          #    branch is tried</span>
       <span class="q">       (?=(b))            # zero-width assertion</span>
     <span class="q">     )*  # any number of times</span>
    <span class="q">    /x</span><span class="sc">;</span>
   <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="i">$&amp;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
   <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="i">$1</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre>
   <span class="w">hello</span>
   <span class="w">aaaaa</span>
   <span class="w">b</span></pre>
<p>Notice that "hello" is only printed once, as when Perl sees that the sixth
iteration of the outermost <code class="inline">(?:)*</code> matches a zero-length string, it stops
the <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
.</p>
<p>The higher-level loops preserve an additional state between iterations:
whether the last match was zero-length.  To break the loop, the following
match after a zero-length match is prohibited to have a length of zero.
This prohibition interacts with backtracking (see <a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>),
and so the <i>second best</i> match is chosen if the <i>best</i> match is of
zero length.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$_</span> = <span class="q">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">s/\w??/&lt;$&amp;&gt;/g</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>results in <pre>
&lt;&gt;&lt;<span class="w">b</span>&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<span class="w">a</span>&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<span class="w">r</span>&gt;&lt;&gt;</code>
.  At each position of the string the best
match given by non-greedy <pre>
<span class="q">??</span></code>
 is the zero-length match, and the <i>second
best</i> match is what is matched by <pre>
\<span class="w">w</span></code>
.  Thus zero-length matches
alternate with one-character-long matches.</p>
<p>Similarly, for repeated <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/()/g</a></code> the second-best match is the match at the
position one notch further in the string.</p>
<p>The additional state of being <i>matched with zero-length</i> is associated with
the matched string, and is reset by each assignment to pos().
Zero-length matches at the end of the previous match are ignored
during <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code>.</p>
<a id="Combining-RE-Pieces"></a><h3 class='h3' >Combining RE Pieces</h3>
<p>Each of the elementary pieces of regular expressions which were described
before (such as <pre>
<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">Z</span></code>
) could match at most one substring
at the given position of the input string.  However, in a typical regular
expression these elementary pieces are combined into more complicated
patterns using combining operators <pre>
<span class="w">ST</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">S</span>|<span class="w">T</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">S</span>*</code>
 etc.
(in these examples <pre>
<span class="w">S</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">T</span></code>
 are regular subexpressions).</p>
<p>Such combinations can include alternatives, leading to a problem of choice:
if we match a regular expression <pre>
<span class="w">a</span>|<span class="w">ab</span></code>
 against <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;abc&quot;</span></code>
, will it match
substring <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;a&quot;</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;ab&quot;</span></code>
?  One way to describe which substring is
actually matched is the concept of backtracking (see <a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>).
However, this description is too low-level and makes you think
in terms of a particular implementation.</p>
<p>Another description starts with notions of "better"/"worse".  All the
substrings which may be matched by the given regular expression can be
sorted from the "best" match to the "worst" match, and it is the "best"
match which is chosen.  This substitutes the question of "what is chosen?"
by the question of "which matches are better, and which are worse?".</p>
<p>Again, for elementary pieces there is no such question, since at most
one match at a given position is possible.  This section describes the
notion of better/worse for combining operators.  In the description
below <pre>
<span class="w">S</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">T</span></code>
 are regular subexpressions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="ST"></a><strong><pre>

</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%3dS)%2c-(%3f%3c%3dS)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?=S)</code>, <code class="inline">(?&lt;=S)</code></strong>
<p>Only the best match for <pre>
<span class="w">S</span></code>
 is considered.  (This is important only if
<pre>
<span class="w">S</span></code>
 has capturing parentheses, and backreferences are used somewhere
else in the whole regular expression.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f!S)%2c-(%3f%3c!S)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?!S)</code>, <code class="inline">(?&lt;!S)</code></strong>

<p>The ordering is the same as for the regular expression which is
the result of EXPR, or the pattern contained by capture group <i>PARNO</i>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f(condition)yes-pattern%7cno-pattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)</code></strong>
<p>Recall that which of <pre>
<span class="w">yes</span>-<span class="w">pattern</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no-pattern</a></code> actually matches is
already determined.  The ordering of the matches is the same as for the
chosen subexpression.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above recipes describe the ordering of matches <i>at a given position</i>.
One more rule is needed to understand how a match is determined for the
whole regular expression: a match at an earlier position is always better
than a match at a later position.</p>
<a id="Creating-Custom-RE-Engines"></a><h3 class='h3' >Creating Custom RE Engines</h3>
<p>As of Perl 5.10.0, one can create custom regular expression engines.  This
is not for the faint of heart, as they have to plug in at the C level.  See
<a href="perlreapi.html">perlreapi</a> for more details.</p>
<p>As an alternative, overloaded constants (see <a href="overload.html">overload</a>) provide a simple
way to extend the functionality of the RE engine, by substituting one
pattern for another.</p>
<p>Suppose that we want to enable a new RE escape-sequence <pre>
\<span class="w">Y</span>|</code>
 which
matches at a boundary between whitespace characters and non-whitespace
characters.  Note that <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?=\S)(?</span>&lt;!\<span class="w">S</span><span class="s">)</span>|<span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?!\S)(?</span>&lt;=\<span class="w">S</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 matches exactly
at these positions, so we want to have each <pre>
\<span class="w">Y</span>|</code>
 in the place of the
more complicated version.  We can create a module <pre>
<span class="w">customre</span></code>
 to do
this:</p>
<pre>
<a name="package-customre"></a>    package <span class="i">customre</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">overload</span><span class="sc">;</span>

<a name="import"></a>    sub <span class="m">import</span> <span class="s">{</span>
      <a class="l_k" href="functions/shift.html">shift</a><span class="sc">;</span>
      <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;No argument to customre::import allowed&quot;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="i">@_</span><span class="sc">;</span>
      <span class="w">overload::constant</span> <span class="q">&#39;qr&#39;</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> \<span class="i">&amp;convert</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>

<a name="invalid"></a>    sub <span class="m">invalid</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;/$_[0]/: invalid escape &#39;\\$_[1]&#39;&quot;</span><span class="s">}</span>

    <span class="c"># We must also take care of not escaping the legitimate \\Y|</span>
    <span class="c"># sequence, hence the presence of &#39;\\&#39; in the conversion rules.</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">%rules</span> = <span class="s">(</span> <span class="q">&#39;\\&#39;</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="q">&#39;\\\\&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span>
                  <span class="q">&#39;Y|&#39;</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="q">qr/(?=\S)(?&lt;!\S)|(?!\S)(?&lt;=\S)/</span> <span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span>
<a name="convert"></a>    sub <span class="m">convert</span> <span class="s">{</span>
      <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$re</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/shift.html">shift</a><span class="sc">;</span>
      <span class="i">$re</span> =~ <span class="q">s{</span>
                <span class="q">                \\ ( \\ | Y . )</span>
              <span class="q">              }</span>
              <span class="q">              { $rules{$1} or invalid($re,$1) }sgex</span><span class="sc">;</span>
      <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$re</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>Now <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">customre</span></code>
 enables the new escape in constant regular
expressions, i.e., those without any runtime variable interpolations.
As documented in <a href="overload.html">overload</a>, this conversion will work only over
literal parts of regular expressions.  For <pre>
\<span class="w">Y</span>|<span class="i">$re</span>\<span class="w">Y</span>|</code>
 the variable
part of this regular expression needs to be converted explicitly
(but only if the special meaning of <pre>
\<span class="w">Y</span>|</code>
 should be enabled inside $re):</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">customre</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = &lt;&gt;<span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/chomp.html">chomp</a> <span class="i">$re</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="w">customre::convert</span> <span class="i">$re</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">/\Y|$re\Y|/</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<a id="PCRE%2fPython-Support"></a><h3 class='h3' >PCRE/Python Support</h3>
<p>As of Perl 5.10.0, Perl supports several Python/PCRE-specific extensions
to the regex syntax. While Perl programmers are encouraged to use the
Perl-specific syntax, the following are also accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="(%3fP%3cNAME%3epattern)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?P&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)</code></strong>
<p>Define a named capture group. Equivalent to <code class="inline">(?&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3fP%3dNAME)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?P=NAME)</code></strong>
<p>Backreference to a named capture group. Equivalent to <pre>
\<span class="i">g</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">NAME</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3fP%3eNAME)"></a><strong><code class="inline">(?P&gt;NAME)</code></strong>
<p>Subroutine call to a named capture group. Equivalent to <code class="inline">(?&amp;NAME)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a id="BUGS"></a><h2 class='h2' >BUGS</h2>
<p>Many regular expression constructs don't work on EBCDIC platforms.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues with regard to case-insensitive matching
in Unicode rules.  See <pre>
<span class="w">i</span></code>
 under <a href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a> above.</p>
<p>This document varies from difficult to understand to completely
and utterly opaque.  The wandering prose riddled with jargon is
hard to fathom in several places.</p>
