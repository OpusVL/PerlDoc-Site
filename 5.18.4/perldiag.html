<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<a id="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class='h2' >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (W) A warning (optional).</li><li>    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).</li><li>    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).</li><li>    (F) A fatal error (trappable).</li><li>    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).</li><li>    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).</li><li>    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</li></ol></div><p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.  E.g. <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">W</span> <span class="w">closed</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 means a warning in the <pre>
<span class="w">closed</span></code>
 category.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting <pre>
<span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code>

to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="functions/eval.html">eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.
See <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="accept()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>accept() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/accept.html">accept</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Allocation-too-large%3a-%25x"></a><strong>Allocation too large: %x</strong>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%25c'-allowed-only-after-types-%25s"></a><strong>'%c' allowed only after types %s</strong>
<p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE%3a%3a%25s()%2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-%26"></a><strong>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code>
 pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <pre>
<span class="i">CORE::</span></code>
 prefix
on the operator (e.g. <pre>
<span class="i">CORE::</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/log.html">log</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">Subroutine Attributes in perlsub</a> or
<a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator"></a><strong>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</strong>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <pre>
-</code>
 character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> was synonymous with
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-y//</a></code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25s-resolved-as-%25s"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c-resolved-as-operator-%25c"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) <pre>
<span class="i">%</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="i">&amp;</span></code>
, and <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
 are both infix operators (modulus,
bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters
(denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something
like <pre>
<span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="w">foo</span></code>
 that might be interpreted as either of them.  We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more
clear -- in the example given, you might write <pre>
<span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 if you
really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <pre>
<span class="i">@</span>{<span class="w">foo</span>}</code>
, which might be
asking for the variable <pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span></code>
, or it might be calling a function
named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted
the variable, you can just write <pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span></code>
.  If you wanted to call the
function, write <pre>
<span class="i">@</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code>
 ... or you could just not have a variable
and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%5b...%5d%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s%5b...%5d"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</strong>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%7b...%7d%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s%7b...%7d"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span>}</code>
 (where foo represents
the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number
2 of the array named <pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span></code>
, in which case please write <pre>
<span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">2</span>]</code>
, or you
might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named
foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns.  If you meant
that, write <pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code>
.</p>
<p>In regular expressions, the <pre>
<span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span>}</code>
 syntax is sometimes necessary
to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
<pre>
<span class="q">/$length[2345]/</span></code>
, for instance, will be interpreted as <pre>
<span class="i">$length</span></code>
 followed
by the character class <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2345</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
.  If an array subscript is what you
want, you can avoid the warning by changing <pre>
<span class="q">/${length[2345]}/</span></code>
 to the
unsightly <pre>
<span class="q">/${\$length[2345]}/</span></code>
, by renaming your array to something
that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning
off warnings with <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;ambiguous&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ambiguous-use-of--%25s-resolved-as--%26%25s()"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like <pre>
-<span class="w">foo</span></code>
, which might be the
string <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;-foo&quot;</span></code>
, or a call to the function <pre>
<span class="w">foo</span></code>
, negated.  If you meant
the string, just write <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;-foo&quot;</span></code>
.  If you meant the function call,
write <pre>
-<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%7c'-and-'%3c'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a><strong>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%7c'-and-'%3e'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a><strong>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p>
<pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Applying-%25s-to-%25s-will-act-on-scalar(%25s)"></a><strong>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</strong>
<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<pre>
<span class="q">//</span></code>
), substitution (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code>), and
transliteration (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr///</a></code>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash) and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="functions/grep.html">grep</a> and <a href="functions/map.html">map</a> for
alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd"></a><strong>Arg too short for msgsnd</strong>

<li><a id="%25s-argument-is-not-a-subroutine-name"></a><strong>%s argument is not a subroutine name</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() for <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 will generate this
error.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Argument-%22%25s%22-isn't-numeric%25s"></a><strong>Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s</strong>
<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer "%s"</strong>
<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O
system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers
take care of transforming data between external and internal
representations.)  Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this
point and did not attempt to push this layer.  If your program
didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the
result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Array-%40%25s-missing-the-%40-in-argument-%25d-of-%25s()"></a><strong>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="A-sequence-of-multiple-spaces-in-a-charnames-alias-definition-is-deprecated"></a><strong>A sequence of multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in
a row.  Change them to single spaces.  Usually these names are defined
in the <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="w">alias</span></code>
 import argument to <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">charnames</span></code>
, but they could be
defined by a translator installed into <pre>
<span class="i">$^H</span>{<span class="w">charnames</span>}</code>
.  See
<a href="charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">CUSTOM ALIASES in charnames</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="assertion-botched%3a-%25s"></a><strong>assertion botched: %s</strong>
<p>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Assertion-failed%3a-file-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Assertion failed: file "%s"</strong>
<p>(X) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Assigning-non-zero-to-%24%5b-is-no-longer-possible"></a><strong>Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</strong>
<p>(F) When the "array_base" feature is disabled (e.g., under <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="v">v5.16</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
)
the special variable <pre>
<span class="i">$[</span></code>
, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar"></a><strong>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</strong>
<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="A-thread-exited-while-%25d-threads-were-running"></a><strong>A thread exited while %d threads were running</strong>
<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily
the main thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea first to collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then to exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="threads.html">threads</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-'%25s'-in-a-restricted-hash"></a><strong>Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</strong>
<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference"></a><strong>Attempt to bless into a reference</strong>
<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into.  You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$proto</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you intended</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/ref.html">ref</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$proto</span><span class="s">)</span> || <span class="i">$proto</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;$proto&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-clear-deleted-array"></a><strong>Attempt to clear deleted array</strong>
<p>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed.
Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code.  This
can also happen if XS code calls <pre>
<span class="w">av_clear</span></code>
 from a custom magic
callback on the array.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-delete-disallowed-key-'%25s'-from-a-restricted-hash"></a><strong>Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</strong>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-delete-readonly-key-'%25s'-from-a-restricted-hash"></a><strong>Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</strong>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-free-non-arena-SV%3a-0x%25x"></a><strong>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</strong>
<p>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string-'%25s'%25s"></a><strong>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</strong>
<p>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely%3a-SV-0x%25x"></a><strong>Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</strong>
<p>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
free_tmps() routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the
free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers"></a><strong>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</strong>
<p>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar%3a-SV-0x%25x"></a><strong>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</strong>
<p>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or
that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-join-self"></a><strong>Attempt to join self</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the join() to some other thread.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value"></a><strong>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</strong>
<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the "p" pack() template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the "p" pack() template to
avoid this warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-reload-%25s-aborted."></a><strong>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> that failed to
compile once already.  Perl will not try to compile this file again
unless you delete its entry from %INC.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and
<a href="perlvar.html#%25INC">%INC in perlvar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-set-length-of-freed-array"></a><strong>Attempt to set length of freed array</strong>
<p>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has
been freed.  You can do this by storing a reference to the
scalar representing the last index of an array and later
assigning through that reference.  For example</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$r</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a> <span class="s">{</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">@a</span><span class="sc">;</span> \<span class="i">$#a</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$$r</span> = <span class="n">503</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr"></a><strong>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</strong>
<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr()
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <a href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attribute-%22locked%22-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Attribute "locked" is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the
"locked" attribute on a code reference.  The :locked attribute is
obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed, and
will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Attribute-%22unique%22-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Attribute "unique" is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify
the "unique" attribute on an array, hash or scalar reference.
The :unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and
will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="av_reify-called-on-tied-array"></a><strong>av_reify called on tied array</strong>
<p>(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i>
confused about <pre>
<span class="i">@_</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">@DB::args</span></code>
 being tied.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-arg-length-for-%25s%2c-is-%25u%2c-should-be-%25d"></a><strong>Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</strong>
<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl()
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct msqid_ds *), sizeof(struct semid_ds *), and
sizeof(struct shmid_ds *).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-evalled-substitution-pattern"></a><strong>Bad evalled substitution pattern</strong>
<p>(F) You've used the <code class="inline">/e</code> switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-filehandle%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Bad filehandle: %s</strong>
<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
open(), or did it in another package.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-free()-ignored"></a><strong>Bad free() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <pre>
<span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 0.</p>
<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with "hard"
dynamic linking, like <pre>
<span class="w">AIX</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">OS</span>/<span class="n">2</span></code>
.  It is a bug of <pre>
<span class="w">Berkeley</span> <span class="w">DB</span></code>

which is left unnoticed if <pre>
<span class="w">DB</span></code>
 uses <i>forgiving</i> system malloc().</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-hash"></a><strong>Bad hash</strong>
<p>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Badly-placed-()'s"></a><strong>Badly placed ()'s</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-name-after-%25s"></a><strong>Bad name after %s</strong>
<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="q">&#39;myvar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$sym</span> = <span class="w">mypack::</span><span class="i">$var</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>is not the same as</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="q">&#39;myvar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$sym</span> = <span class="q">&quot;mypack::$var&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-plugin-affecting-keyword-'%25s'"></a><strong>Bad plugin affecting keyword '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) An extension using the keyword plugin mechanism violated the
plugin API.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-realloc()-ignored"></a><strong>Bad realloc() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something that
had never been malloc()ed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can
be disabled by setting the environment variable <pre>
<span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 1.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-symbol-for-array"></a><strong>Bad symbol for array</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-symbol-for-dirhandle"></a><strong>Bad symbol for dirhandle</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-symbol-for-filehandle"></a><strong>Bad symbol for filehandle</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bad-symbol-for-hash"></a><strong>Bad symbol for hash</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a><strong>Bareword found in conditional</strong>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FOO</span> || <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span> <span class="i">TYPO</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TYOP</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>The <pre>
<span class="w">strict</span></code>
 pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bareword-%22%25s%22-not-allowed-while-%22strict-subs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) With "strict subs" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the "=&gt;"
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bareword-%22%25s%22-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a><strong>Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package</strong>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <pre>
<span class="w">Foo::</span></code>
, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="BEGIN-failed--compilation-aborted"></a><strong>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</strong>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted"></a><strong>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</strong>
<p>(F) Perl found a <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/BEGIN.html">BEGIN</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 subroutine (or a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/BEGIN.html">BEGIN</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/BEGIN.html">BEGIN</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%5c1-better-written-as-%241"></a><strong>\1 better written as $1</strong>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Binary-number-%3e-0b11111111111111111111111111111111-non-portable"></a><strong>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="bind()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>bind() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to
check the return value of your socket() call?  See <a href="functions/bind.html">bind</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="binmode()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><strong>binmode() on closed filehandle %s</strong>
<p>(W unopened) You tried binmode() on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22%5cb%7b%22-is-deprecated%3b-use-%22%5cb%5c%7b%22-or-%22%5cb%5b%7b%5d%22-instead-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>"\b{" is deprecated; use "\b\{" or "\b[{]" instead in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>

<p>(W deprecated) Use of an unescaped "{" immediately following a

\<span class="w">b</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">B</span></code>
 is now deprecated so as to reserve its use for Perl
itself in a future release.  You can either precede the brace with a
backslash, or enclose it in square brackets; the latter is the way to go
if the pattern delimiters are <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bit-vector-size-%3e-32-non-portable"></a><strong>Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bizarre-copy-of-%25s"></a><strong>Bizarre copy of %s</strong>
<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
copiable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Buffer-overflow-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Bizarre-SvTYPE-%5b%25d%5d"></a><strong>Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</strong>
<p>(P) When starting a new thread or return values from a thread, Perl
encountered an invalid data type.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Callback-called-exit"></a><strong>Callback called exit</strong>
<p>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via call_sv()
exited by calling exit.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s()-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a><strong>%s() called too early to check prototype</strong>
<p>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cannot-compress-integer-in-pack"></a><strong>Cannot compress integer in pack</strong>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was too large to compress.  The BER
compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308).
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cannot-compress-negative-numbers-in-pack"></a><strong>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</strong>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was negative.  The BER compressed integer
format can only be used with positive integers.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cannot-convert-a-reference-to-%25s-to-typeglob"></a><strong>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</strong>
<p>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference
in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax.
The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is
no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cannot-copy-to-%25s"></a><strong>Cannot copy to %s</strong>
<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that cannot
be directly assigned to.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cannot-find-encoding-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Cannot find encoding "%s"</strong>
<p>(S io) You tried to apply an encoding that did not exist to a filehandle,
either with open() or binmode().</p>

<p>(P) You somehow managed to call <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a></code> on an array that does not
keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot be made to
do so.  Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
Perl code, but are only used internally.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can-only-compress-unsigned-integers-in-pack"></a><strong>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</strong>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed
integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you attempted
to compress something else.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-bless-non-reference-value"></a><strong>Can't bless non-reference value</strong>
<p>(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"
encapsulation of objects.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22break%22-in-a-loop-topicalizer"></a><strong>Can't "break" in a loop topicalizer</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/break.html">break</a></code>, but you're in a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a></code> block rather than
a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/given.html">given</a></code> block.  You probably meant to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last.html">last</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22break%22-outside-a-given-block"></a><strong>Can't "break" outside a given block</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/break.html">break</a></code>, but you're not inside a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/given.html">given</a></code> block.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-an-undefined-value"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value</strong>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something
like this will reproduce the error:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$BADREF</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="w">process</span> <span class="i">$BADREF</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="sc">;</span>

</li>
<li><a id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-unblessed-reference"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</strong>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-without-a-package-or-object-reference"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" without a package or object reference</strong>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a
defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
Something like this will reproduce the error:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$BADREF</span> = <span class="n">42</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="w">process</span> <span class="i">$BADREF</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="sc">;</span>

</li>
<li><a id="Can't-chdir-to-%25s"></a><strong>Can't chdir to %s</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline">perl -x/foo/bar</code>, but <i>/foo/bar</i> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-check-filesystem-of-script-%22%25s%22-for-nosuid"></a><strong>Can't check filesystem of script "%s" for nosuid</strong>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for
nosuid.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-coerce-%25s-to-%25s-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't coerce %s to %s in %s</strong>
<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">*foo</span> += <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>You CAN say</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="i">*foo</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$foo</span> += <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>but then $foo no longer contains a glob.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22continue%22-outside-a-when-block"></a><strong>Can't "continue" outside a when block</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>, but you're not inside a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/when.html">when</a></code>
or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/default.html">default</a></code> block.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-create-pipe-mailbox"></a><strong>Can't create pipe mailbox</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The process is suffering from exhausted
quotas or other plumbing problems.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-declare-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't declare %s in "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as "my", "our" or
"state" variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22default%22-outside-a-topicalizer"></a><strong>Can't "default" outside a topicalizer</strong>
<p>(F) You have used a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/default.html">default</a></code> block that is neither inside a
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a></code> loop nor a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/given.html">given</a></code> block.  (Note that this error is
issued on exit from the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/default.html">default</a></code> block, so you won't get the
error if you use an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-do-inplace-edit%3a-%25s-is-not-a-regular-file"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) You tried to use the <strong>-i</strong> switch on a special file, such as
a file in /dev, a FIFO or an uneditable directory.  The file was ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-do-inplace-edit-on-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated
reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-do-inplace-edit-without-backup"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit without backup</strong>
<p>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
reading from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say
<pre>
-<span class="w">i</span>.<span class="w">bak</span></code>
, or some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-do-inplace-edit%3a-%25s-would-not-be-unique"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</strong>
<p>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during
inplace editing with the <strong>-i</strong> switch.  The file was ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-do-waitpid-with-flags"></a><strong>Can't do waitpid with flags</strong>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-emulate--%25s-on-%23!-line"></a><strong>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</strong>
<p>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this
point.  For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <strong>-x</strong> on the #!
line.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%25s-%25s-endian-%25ss-on-this-platform"></a><strong>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</strong>
<p>(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian,
or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or
little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-exec-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't exec "%s": %s</strong>
<p>(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
<pre>
<span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support
#! at all.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-exec-%25s"></a><strong>Can't exec %s</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may
need to mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-execute-%25s"></a><strong>Can't execute %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the copies of the script to execute
found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-an-opnumber-for-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't find an opnumber for "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) A string of a form <pre>
<span class="i">CORE::</span><span class="w">word</span></code>
 was given to prototype(), but there
is no builtin with the name <pre>
<span class="w">word</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-%25s-character-property-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't find %s character property "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You used <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 but the character property by that name
could not be found.  Maybe you misspelled the name of the property?
See <a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>
for a complete list of available official properties.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-label-%25s"></a><strong>Can't find label %s</strong>
<p>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
possible for us to go to.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH"></a><strong>Can't find %s on PATH</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH%2c-'.'-not-in-PATH"></a><strong>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-string-terminator-%25s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a><strong>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</strong>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);</li></ol></div><p>If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there
may not be a linebreak after it.  A good programmer's editor will have
a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).  See
<a href="perlop.html">perlop</a> for the full details on here-documents.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-find-Unicode-property-definition-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't find Unicode property definition "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You may have tried to use <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 which means a Unicode
property (for example <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Lu</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 matches all uppercase
letters).  If you did mean to use a Unicode property, see
<a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>
for a complete list of available properties.  If you didn't
mean to use a Unicode property, escape the <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
, either by
<pre>
\\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 (just the <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
) or by <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span>\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 (the rest of the string, or
until <pre>
\<span class="w">E</span></code>
).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-fork%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't fork: %s</strong>
<p>(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-fork%2c-trying-again-in-5-seconds"></a><strong>Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds</strong>
<p>(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried
after five seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer%3f"></a><strong>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat.html">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a><strong>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a><strong>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22goto%22-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a><strong>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop</strong>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22goto%22-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a><strong>Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block</strong>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-a-sort-sub-(or-similar-callback)"></a><strong>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</strong>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval-%25s"></a><strong>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</strong>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval
"string" or block.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-ignore-signal-CHLD%2c-forcing-to-default"></a><strong>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</strong>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-kill-a-non-numeric-process-ID"></a><strong>Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</strong>
<p>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to
attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric
process identifier.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22last%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "last" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a "loopish"
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
<a href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-linearize-anonymous-symbol-table"></a><strong>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</strong>
<p>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-load-'%25s'-for-module-%25s"></a><strong>Can't load '%s' for module %s</strong>
<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your
dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library
that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old
dynamic extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-%25s"></a><strong>Can't localize lexical variable %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my" or "state".  This is not allowed.  If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with
the package name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-localize-through-a-reference"></a><strong>Can't localize through a reference</strong>
<p>(F) You said something like <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$$ref</span></code>
, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-%25s"></a><strong>Can't locate %s</strong>
<p>(F) You said to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> (or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be found.
Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless
the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
<a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and <a href="lib.html">lib</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-auto%2f%25s.al-in-%40INC"></a><strong>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</strong>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <pre>
<span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code>

the file, say, by doing <pre>
<span class="w">make</span> <span class="w">install</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-loadable-object-for-module-%25s-in-%40INC"></a><strong>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</strong>
<p>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a> module was
unable to locate this library.  See <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-object-method-%22%25s%22-via-package-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-package-%25s-for-%40%25s%3a%3aISA"></a><strong>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</strong>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-locate-PerlIO%25s"></a><strong>Can't locate PerlIO%s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, "&gt;:nosuchlayer", "somefile").</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-make-list-assignment-to-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><strong>Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</strong>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-make-loaded-symbols-global-on-this-platform-while-loading-%25s"></a><strong>Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</strong>
<p>(W) A module passed the flag 0x01 to DynaLoader::dl_load_file() to request
that symbols from the stated file are made available globally within the
process, but that functionality is not available on this platform.  Whilst
the module likely will still work, this may prevent the perl interpreter
from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link directly to
functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-modify-%25s-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't modify %s in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a><strong>Can't modify nonexistent substring</strong>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-modify-non-lvalue-subroutine-call"></a><strong>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</strong>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such.  See <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">Lvalue subroutines in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-msgrcv-to-read-only-var"></a><strong>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</strong>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22next%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "next" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See <a href="functions/next.html">next</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-%25s"></a><strong>Can't open %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with
the PERL_XMLDUMP environment variable set, but the file
named by that variable could not be opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't open %s: %s</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <pre>
&lt;&gt;</code>

filehandle, either implicitly under the <pre>
-<span class="w">n</span></code>
 or <pre>
-p</code>
 command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually
this is because you don't have read permission for a file which
you named on the command line.</p>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <strong>-e</strong> switch, but <i>/dev/null</i> (or
your operating system's equivalent) could not be opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-a-reference"></a><strong>Can't open a reference</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$ref</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a><strong>Can't open bidirectional pipe</strong>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">CMD</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;|cmd|&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
"&gt;", and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-error-file-%25s-as-stderr"></a><strong>Can't open error file %s as stderr</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-input-file-%25s-as-stdin"></a><strong>Can't open input file %s as stdin</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the
command line for reading.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-output-file-%25s-as-stdout"></a><strong>Can't open output file %s as stdout</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-output-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)"></a><strong>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-open-perl-script-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't open perl script "%s": %s</strong>
<p>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.</p>
<p>If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don't have to type the path or <pre>
<span class="q">`which $scriptname`</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-read-CRTL-environ"></a><strong>Can't read CRTL environ</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not
searched.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22redo%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "redo" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a href="functions/redo.html">redo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-remove-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><strong>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-rename-%25s-to-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><strong>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <strong>-i</strong> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-reopen-input-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)-in-binary-mode"></a><strong>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-reset-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><strong>Can't reset %ENV on this system</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/reset.html">reset('E')</a></code> or similar, which tried to reset
all variables in the current package beginning with "E".  In
the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not
supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-resolve-method-%22%25s%22-overloading-%22%25s%22-in-package-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't resolve method "%s" overloading "%s" in package "%s"</strong>
<p>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package.  If the method name is <code class="inline">???</code>, this is an internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-return-%25s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't return outside a subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-return-%25s-to-lvalue-scalar-context"></a><strong>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl
think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-stat-script-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't stat script "%s"</strong>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have it
open already.  Bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-take-log-of-%25g"></a><strong>Can't take log of %g</strong>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-take-sqrt-of-%25g"></a><strong>Can't take sqrt of %g</strong>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-undef-active-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't undef active subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-upgrade-%25s-(%25d)-to-%25d"></a><strong>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</strong>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-'%25c'-after--mname"></a><strong>Can't use '%c' after -mname</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <strong>-m</strong> switch, but you put something
other than "=" after the module name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup"></a><strong>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</strong>
<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%Some::Package::</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-an-undefined-value-as-%25s-reference"></a><strong>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</strong>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-bareword-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-%25!-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available"></a><strong>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</strong>
<p>(F) The first time the <pre>
<span class="i">%!</span></code>
 hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <pre>
<span class="i">$!</span></code>
 errno values.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-both-'%3c'-and-'%3e'-after-type-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</strong>
<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-%25s-for-loop-variable"></a><strong>Can't use %s for loop variable</strong>
<p>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
foreach.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-global-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't use global %s in "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-'%25c'-in-a-group-with-different-byte-order-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-%22my-%25s%22-in-sort-comparison"></a><strong>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison</strong>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-%25s-ref-as-%25s-ref"></a><strong>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</strong>
<p>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-string-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span></code>
 blocks to prevent it happening accidentally.  See
<a href="perlref.html#Symbolic-references">Symbolic references in perlref</a>.  This can be triggered by an <pre>
<span class="i">@</span></code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">$</span></code>

in a double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a variable,
for example in <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;</span></code>
, which says to treat the contents
of <pre>
<span class="i">$twitter_id</span></code>
 as an array reference; use a <pre>
\</code>
 to have a literal <pre>
<span class="i">@</span></code>

symbol followed by the contents of <pre>
<span class="i">$twitter_id</span></code>
: <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;user \@$twitter_id&quot;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-subscript-on-%25s"></a><strong>Can't use subscript on %s</strong>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-use-%5c%25c-to-mean-%24%25c-in-expression"></a><strong>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</strong>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-weaken-a-nonreference"></a><strong>Can't weaken a nonreference</strong>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-%22when%22-outside-a-topicalizer"></a><strong>Can't "when" outside a topicalizer</strong>
<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a></code>
loop nor a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/given.html">given</a></code> block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/when.html">when</a></code> block, so you won't get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Can't-x%3d-to-read-only-value"></a><strong>Can't x= to read-only value</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Character-following-%22%5cc%22-must-be-ASCII"></a><strong>Character following "\c" must be ASCII</strong>
<p>(F)(W deprecated, syntax) In <code class="inline">\c<i>X</i></code>, <i>X</i> must be an ASCII character.
It is planned to make this fatal in all instances in Perl v5.20.  In the
cases where it isn't fatal, the character this evaluates to is
derived by exclusive or'ing the code point of this character with 0x40.</p>
<p>Note that non-alphabetic ASCII characters are discouraged here as well,
and using non-printable ones will be deprecated starting in v5.18.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Character-in-'C'-format-wrapped-in-pack"></a><strong>Character in 'C' format wrapped in pack</strong>
<p>(W pack) You said</p>

<p>If you actually want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the <pre>

 format
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Character-in-'W'-format-wrapped-in-pack"></a><strong>Character in 'W' format wrapped in pack</strong>
<p>(W pack) You said</p>
<pre>

<p>where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255.  However, <pre>
<span class="w">U0</span></code>
-mode
expects all values to fall in the interval [0, 255], so Perl behaved
as if you meant:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/pack.html">pack</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">&quot;U0W&quot;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$x</span> &amp; <span class="n">255</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>

<span class="q">&quot;c&quot;</span></code>
 format
is only for encoding native operating system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC,

</li>
<li><a id="Character-in-'%25c'-format-wrapped-in-unpack"></a><strong>Character in '%c' format wrapped in unpack</strong>

<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The <code class="inline">\c<i>X</i></code> construct is intended to be a way
to specify non-printable characters.  You used it with a "{" which
evaluates to ";", which is printable.  It is planned to remove the
ability to specify a semi-colon this way in Perl 5.20.  Just use a
semi-colon or a backslash-semi-colon without the "\c".</p>

<p>(W syntax) The <code class="inline">\c<i>X</i></code> construct is intended to be a way to specify

written as simply itself, perhaps preceded by a backslash for non-word
characters.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Cloning-substitution-context-is-unimplemented"></a><strong>Cloning substitution context is unimplemented</strong>

<p>(W io) The dirhandle you tried to close is either closed or not really
a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Closure-prototype-called"></a><strong>Closure prototype called</strong>
<p>(F) If a closure has attributes, the subroutine passed to an attribute

<p>(S utf8, non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum
of U+10FFFF.</p>
<p>Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up
to the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system,
but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  At one time,
it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF,
but not higher.  Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a
32 bit word.</p>
<p>None of the Unicode or Perl-defined properties will match a non-Unicode
code point.  For example,</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/chr.html">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0x7FF_FFFF</span><span class="s">)</span> =~ <span class="q">/\p{Any}/</span></pre>
<p>will not match, because the code point is not in Unicode.  But</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/chr.html">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0x7FF_FFFF</span><span class="s">)</span> =~ <span class="q">/\P{Any}/</span></pre>
<p>will match.</p>
<p>This may be counterintuitive at times, as both these fail:</p>
<pre>
 <a class="l_k" href="functions/chr.html">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0x110000</span><span class="s">)</span> =~ <span class="q">/\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}/</span>      <span class="c"># Fails.</span>

<p>(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> statement.

<li><a id="Complex-regular-subexpression-recursion-limit-(%25d)-exceeded"></a><strong>Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</strong>
<p>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited
to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  ("Simple" and "medium" situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/while.html">while</a></code>) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <a href="perlfaq2.html">perlfaq2</a> for information

<li><a id="cond_broadcast()-called-on-unlocked-variable"></a><strong>cond_broadcast() called on unlocked variable</strong>
<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to
call cond_broadcast() on a variable which wasn't locked.
The cond_broadcast() function is used to wake up another thread
that is waiting in a cond_wait().  To ensure that the signal isn't
sent before the other thread has a chance to enter the wait, it
is usual for the signaling thread first to wait for a lock on
variable.  This lock attempt will only succeed after the other
thread has entered cond_wait() and thus relinquished the lock.</p>

<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to

<p>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Count-after-length%2fcode-in-unpack"></a><strong>Count after length/code in unpack</strong>

<p>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in

<p>This threshold can be changed from 100, by recompiling the <i>perl</i> binary,
setting the C pre-processor macro <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="defined(%40array)-is-deprecated"></a><strong>defined(@array) is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <code class="inline">if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="defined(%25hash)-is-deprecated"></a><strong>defined(%hash) is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined()</a></code> is not usually right on hashes and has been
discouraged since 5.004.</p>
<p>Although <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
 is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators,
weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
.
These things make <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
 fairly useless in practice.</p>
<p>If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean

<p>If you had <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%Foo::Bar::QUUX</span></code>
 to check whether such a package
variable exists then that's never really been reliable, and isn't
a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether
it's loaded, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f(DEFINE)....)-does-not-allow-branches-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in--m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>(?(DEFINE)....) does not allow branches in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in

<p>(F) You used something like <code class="inline">(?(DEFINE)...|..)</code> which is illegal.  The
most likely cause of this error is that you left out a parenthesis inside
of the <code class="inline">....</code> part.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-defines-neither-package-nor-VERSION--version-check-failed"></a><strong>%s defines neither package nor VERSION--version check failed</strong>
<p>(F) You said something like "use Module 42" but in the Module file
there are neither package declarations nor a <pre>
<span class="i">$VERSION</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Delimiter-for-here-document-is-too-long"></a><strong>Delimiter for here document is too long</strong>
<p>(F) In a here document construct like <code class="inline">&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <pre>
<span class="w">FOO</span></code>
 is too
long for Perl to handle.  You have to be seriously twisted to write code
that triggers this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Deprecated-use-of-my()-in-false-conditional"></a><strong>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="n">0</span></code>
.  There
has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable
not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false
conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
static variable.  Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people
relying on this behavior.  You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p>
<pre>
<a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="n">0</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre>
<a name="f"></a>    <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you can also use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state.html">state</a></code> variables to have
lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="feature.html">feature</a>):</p>
<pre>

</li>
<li><a id="DESTROY-created-new-reference-to-dead-object-'%25s'"></a><strong>DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) A DESTROY() method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed.  Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather
than to create a dangling reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Did-not-produce-a-valid-header"></a><strong>Did not produce a valid header</strong>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a><strong>%s did not return a true value</strong>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Did-you-mean-%26%25s-instead%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</strong>
<p>(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or
some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Did-you-mean-%22local%22-instead-of-%22our%22%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean "local" instead of "our"?)</strong>
<p>(W misc) Remember that "our" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Did-you-mean-%24-or-%40-instead-of-%25%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</strong>
<p>(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or
@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Died"></a><strong>Died</strong>
<p>(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="%25s-does-not-define-%25s%3a%3aVERSION--version-check-failed"></a><strong>%s does not define %s::VERSION--version check failed</strong>

.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%2f'-does-not-take-a-repeat-count"></a><strong>'/' does not take a repeat count</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Don't-know-how-to-handle-magic-of-type-'%25s'"></a><strong>Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</strong>
<p>(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="do_study%3a-out-of-memory"></a><strong>do_study: out of memory</strong>
<p>(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Do-you-need-to-predeclare-%25s%3f)"></a><strong>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</strong>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
"sub", "package", "require", or "use" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
"sub foo;" or "package FOO;" to enter a "forward" declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="dump()-better-written-as-CORE%3a%3adump()"></a><strong>dump() better written as CORE::dump()</strong>
<p>(W misc) You used the obsolescent <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/dump.html">dump()</a></code> built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as <pre>
<span class="i">CORE::</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/dump.html">dump</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.  Maybe it's a typo.  See <a href="functions/dump.html">dump</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="dump-is-not-supported"></a><strong>dump is not supported</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support dump/undump.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Duplicate-free()-ignored"></a><strong>Duplicate free() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had
already been freed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Duplicate-modifier-'%25c'-after-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><strong>Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s</strong>
<p>(W unpack) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a
type in a pack template.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="elseif-should-be-elsif"></a><strong>elseif should be elsif</strong>
<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword "elseif" in Perl because Larry thinks
it's ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named "elseif" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Empty-%5c%25c%7b%7d-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Empty \%c{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>

 and <pre>
\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in <a href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> and <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.  You used <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 in
a regular expression without specifying the property name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="entering-effective-%25s-failed"></a><strong>entering effective %s failed</strong>
<p>(F) While under the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25ENV-is-aliased-to-%25s"></a><strong>%ENV is aliased to %s</strong>
<p>(F) You're running under taint mode, and the <pre>
<span class="i">%ENV</span></code>
 variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment.  This is potentially insecure.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Error-converting-file-specification-%25s"></a><strong>Error converting file specification %s</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Escape-literal-pattern-white-space-under-%2fx"></a><strong>Escape literal pattern white space under /x</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You compiled a regular expression pattern with <code class="inline">/x</code> to
ignore white space, and you used, as a literal, one of the characters
that Perl plans to eventually treat as white space.  The character must
be escaped somehow, or it will work differently on a future Perl that
does treat it as white space.  The easiest way is to insert a backslash
immediately before it, or to enclose it with square brackets.  This
change is to bring Perl into conformance with Unicode recommendations.
Here are the five characters that generate this warning:
U+0085 NEXT LINE,
U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK,
U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK,
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR,
and
U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Eval-group-in-insecure-regular-expression"></a><strong>Eval-group in insecure regular expression</strong>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion, which
is unsafe.  See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>, and <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Eval-group-not-allowed-at-runtime%2c-use-re-'eval'-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Eval-group not allowed at runtime, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the
<pre>
<span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>

<li><a id="Eval-group-not-allowed%2c-use-re-'eval'-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) A regular expression contained the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the <pre>

m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) You used a pattern that nested too many EVAL calls without consuming
any text.  Restructure the pattern so that text is consumed.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Excessively-long-%3c%3e-operator"></a><strong>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator</strong>
<p>(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the glob() operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="exec%3f-I'm-not-*that*-kind-of-operating-system"></a><strong>exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system</strong>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> function is not implemented on some systems, e.g., Symbian
OS.  See <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a>.</p>

<p>(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Exiting-eval-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting eval via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Exiting-format-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting format via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional means, such as a

</li>
<li><a id="Exiting-pseudo-block-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting pseudo-block via %s</strong>

<p>(F)
You wrote something like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?13</li></ol></div><p>to denote a capturing group of the form
<a href="perlre.html#(%3fPARNO)-(%3f-PARNO)-(%3f%2bPARNO)-(%3fR)-(%3f0)">(?PARNO)</a>,
but omitted the <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;)&quot;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Experimental-%22%25s%22-subs-not-enabled"></a><strong>Experimental "%s" subs not enabled</strong>
<p>(F) To use lexical subs, you must first enable them:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;experimental::lexical_subs&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>

</li>
<li><a id="Explicit-blessing-to-''-(assuming-package-main)"></a><strong>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</strong>
<p>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s%3a-Expression-syntax"></a><strong>%s: Expression syntax</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-failed--call-queue-aborted"></a><strong>%s failed--call queue aborted</strong>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a UNITCHECK,
CHECK, INIT, or END subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the
queue of such routines has been prematurely ended.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="False-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>False [] range "%s" in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like <pre>
\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">[:alpha:]</code>.  The "-"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal "-".  Consider quoting the
"-", "\-".  The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the
problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Fatal-VMS-error-(status%3d%25d)-at-%25s%2c-line-%25d"></a><strong>Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in "at %s" and the line number in "line %d" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a><strong>fcntl is not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="FETCHSIZE-returned-a-negative-value"></a><strong>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</strong>
<p>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Field-too-wide-in-'u'-format-in-pack"></a><strong>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</strong>
<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator
which can't encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified
<pre>
<span class="w">u63</span></code>
 as the format.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-input"></a><strong>Filehandle %s opened only for input</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with "+&lt;" or
"+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-output"></a><strong>Filehandle %s opened only for output</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with "+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&gt;".  If you intended only to
read from the file, use "&lt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.  Another possibility
is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Filehandle-%25s-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-input"></a><strong>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</strong>
<p>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDOUT or STDERR.  This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Filehandle-STDIN-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-output"></a><strong>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</strong>
<p>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDIN.  This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Final-%24-should-be-%5c%24-or-%24name"></a><strong>Final $ should be \$ or $name</strong>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="flock()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><strong>flock() on closed filehandle %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  flock() operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the
same name?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Format-not-terminated"></a><strong>Format not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Format-%25s-redefined"></a><strong>Format %s redefined</strong>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre>
    <span class="s">{</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;redefine&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;format NAME =...&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Found-%3d-in-conditional%2c-should-be-%3d%3d"></a><strong>Found = in conditional, should be ==</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You said</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>when you meant</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> == <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>(or something like that).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-found-where-operator-expected"></a><strong>%s found where operator expected</strong>
<p>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="gdbm-store-returned-%25d%2c-errno-%25d%2c-key-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</strong>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="gethostent-not-implemented"></a><strong>gethostent not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="get%25sname()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>get%sname() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-%25%23o-for-user-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user "%s"</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <pre>
<span class="w">sys</span><span class="i">$getuai</span></code>
 underlying the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getpwnam.html">getpwnam</a></code> operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="getsockopt()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>getsockopt() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/getsockopt.html">getsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="given-is-experimental"></a><strong>given is experimental</strong>
<p>(S experimental::smartmatch) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/given.html">given</a></code> depends on both a lexical <pre>
<span class="i">$_</span></code>
 and
smartmatch, both of which are experimental, so its behavior may change or
even be removed in any future release of perl.
See the explanation under <a href="perlsyn.html#Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">Experimental Details on given and when in perlsyn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Global-symbol-%22%25s%22-requires-explicit-package-name"></a><strong>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name</strong>
<p>(F) You've said "use strict" or "use strict vars", which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using "my" or "state"), 
declared beforehand using "our", or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using "::").</p>
</li>
<li><a id="glob-failed-(%25s)"></a><strong>glob failed (%s)</strong>
<p>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code> and <pre>
<span class="q">&lt;*.c&gt;</span></code>
.  Usually, this means that you supplied a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code>
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell)
is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables
in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as
if it were csh (e.g. <pre>
<span class="w">full_csh</span>=<span class="q">&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</span></code>
); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that <pre>
<span class="w">d_csh</span></code>
 should be <pre>
<span class="q">&#39;undef&#39;</span></code>
) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code class="inline">./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Glob-not-terminated"></a><strong>Glob not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a id="gmtime(%25f)-too-large"></a><strong>gmtime(%f) too large</strong>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong
date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="gmtime(%25f)-too-small"></a><strong>gmtime(%f) too small</strong>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was smaller than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong date.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Got-an-error-from-DosAllocMem"></a><strong>Got an error from DosAllocMem</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="goto-must-have-label"></a><strong>goto must have label</strong>
<p>(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Goto-undefined-subroutine%25s"></a><strong>Goto undefined subroutine%s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 syntax, but
the indicated subroutine hasn't been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="()-group-starts-with-a-count"></a><strong>()-group starts with a count</strong>
<p>(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is supposed to follow
something: a template character or a ()-group.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Group-name-must-start-with-a-non-digit-word-character-in-regex%3b-marked-by--%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by 
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning
they must start with a non-digit word character. A common cause of
this error is using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0). See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-had-compilation-errors."></a><strong>%s had compilation errors.</strong>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <pre>
<span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Had-to-create-%25s-unexpectedly"></a><strong>Had to create %s unexpectedly</strong>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Hash-%25%25s-missing-the-%25-in-argument-%25d-of-%25s()"></a><strong>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-has-too-many-errors"></a><strong>%s has too many errors</strong>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Hexadecimal-number-%3e-0xffffffff-non-portable"></a><strong>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="-i-used-with-no-filenames-on-the-command-line%2c-reading-from-STDIN"></a><strong>-i used with no filenames on the command line, reading from STDIN</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The <pre>
-<span class="w">i</span></code>
 option was passed on the command line, indicating
that the script is intended to edit files inplace, but no files were
given.  This is usually a mistake, since editing STDIN inplace doesn't
make sense, and can be confusing because it can make perl look like
it is hanging when it is really just trying to read from STDIN.  You
should either pass a filename to edit, or remove <pre>
-<span class="w">i</span></code>
 from the command
line.  See <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Identifier-too-long"></a><strong>Identifier too long</strong>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <pre>
<span class="i">$A::B</span></code>
).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ignoring-zero-length-%5cN%7b%7d-in-character-class-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes <pre>
<span class="s">(</span>\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 may return a zero-length
sequence.  When such an escape is used in a character class its
behaviour is not well defined.  Check that the correct escape has
been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal binary digit %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-character-after-'_'-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</strong>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-character-%5c%25o-(carriage-return)"></a><strong>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</strong>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</strong>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-declaration-of-anonymous-subroutine"></a><strong>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) When using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code> keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine,
you must always specify a block of code.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-declaration-of-subroutine-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</strong>
<p>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-division-by-zero"></a><strong>Illegal division by zero</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-modulus-zero"></a><strong>Illegal modulus zero</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don't take to this kindly.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a><strong>Illegal number of bits in vec</strong>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal octal digit %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Illegal-pattern-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Illegal pattern in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F)
You wrote something like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?+foo)</li></ol></div><p>The <pre>

<li><a id="Ill-formed-CRTL-environ-value-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Ill-formed CRTL environ value "%s"</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's
internal environ array, and encountered an element without the <pre>

delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%7c%25s%7c"></a><strong>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(in-cleanup)-%25s"></a><strong>(in cleanup) %s</strong>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <pre>
<span class="w">G_KEEPERR</span></code>
 flag could
also result in this warning.  See <a href="perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">G_KEEPERR in perlcall</a>.</p>

, but you separated them.
Due to an accident of implementation, this prohibition was not enforced,
but we do plan to forbid it in a future Perl version.  This message
serves as giving you fair warning of this pending change.</p>

<li><a id="Incomplete-expression-within-'(%3f%5b-%5d)'-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Incomplete expression within '(?[ ])' in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F)
There was a syntax error within the <code class="inline">(?[ ])</code>.  This can happen if the
expression inside the construct was completely empty, or if there are
too many or few operands for the number of operators.  Perl is not smart
enough to give you a more precise indication as to what is wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Inconsistent-hierarchy-during-C3-merge-of-class-'%25s'%3a-merging-failed-on--parent-'%25s'"></a><strong>Inconsistent hierarchy during C3 merge of class '%s': merging failed on

<p>(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC.  Internally, v-strings are stored as
Unicode code points, and encoded in EBCDIC as UTF-EBCDIC.  The UTF-EBCDIC
encoding is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</p>

</li>
<li><a id="Insecure-dependency-in-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure dependency in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <strong>-T</strong> to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any
such data is used in a "dangerous" operation, you get this error.  See
<a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Insecure-directory-in-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure directory in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if <pre>
<span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
 contains a directory that is writable by
the world.  Also, the PATH must not contain any relative directory.
See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Insecure-%24ENV%7b%25s%7d-while-running-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Insecure-user-defined-property-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure user-defined property %s</strong>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains a call to a user-defined character property
function, i.e. <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">IsFoo</span><span class="s">}</span></code>

</li>
<li><a id="Integer-overflow-in-format-string-for-%25s"></a><strong>Integer overflow in format string for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf.html">printf()</a></code>
or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sprintf.html">sprintf()</a></code> are too large.  The numbers must not overflow the size of
integers for your architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Integer-overflow-in-%25s-number"></a><strong>Integer overflow in %s number</strong>
<p>(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Integer-overflow-in-srand"></a><strong>Integer overflow in srand</strong>
<p>(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit
in your architecture's integer representation.  The number has been
replaced with the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit
architectures).  This means you may be getting less randomness than
you expect, because different random seeds above the maximum will
return the same sequence of random numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Integer-overflow-in-version"></a><strong>Integer overflow in version</strong>
</li>
<li><a id="Integer-overflow-in-version-%25d"></a><strong>Integer overflow in version %d</strong>
<p>(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for
the size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an
element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by trying
to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Internal-disaster-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Internal disaster in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression parser.
The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Internal-inconsistency-in-tracking-vforks"></a><strong>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you've called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork.html">fork</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
<a href="perlvms.html#exec-LIST">exec LIST in perlvms</a>).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Internal-urp-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Internal urp in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>

operators arguments found inside the parentheses.  See
<a href="perlop.html#Terms-and-List-Operators-(Leftward)">Terms and List Operators (Leftward) in perlop</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-%25s-attribute%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Invalid %s attribute: %s</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-character-in-%5cN%7b...%7d%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-%5cN%7b%25s%7d"></a><strong>Invalid character in \N{...}; marked by &lt;-- HERE in \N{%s}</strong>
<p>(F) Only certain characters are valid for character names.  The
indicated one isn't.  See <a href="charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">CUSTOM ALIASES in charnames</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-character-in-charnames-alias-definition%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-'%25s"></a><strong>Invalid character in charnames alias definition; marked by &lt;-- HERE in '%s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to create a custom alias for a character name, with

</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-conversion-in-%25s%3a-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Invalid conversion in %s: "%s"</strong>

<p>(W regexp) The numeric escape (for example <pre>
\<span class="w">xHH</span></code>

didn't correspond to a single character through the conversion
from the encoding specified by the encoding pragma.
The escape was replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) instead.

0 - 9 or A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-module-name-%25s-with--%25c-option%3a-contains-single-'%3a'"></a><strong>Invalid module name %s with -%c option: contains single ':'</strong>
<p>(F) The module argument to perl's <strong>-m</strong> and <strong>-M</strong> command-line options
cannot contain single colons in the module name, but only in the

,
where <pre>
<span class="w">foo</span></code>
 is not a valid method resolution order (MRO).  Currently,
the only valid ones supported are <pre>
<span class="w">dfs</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">c3</span></code>
, unless you have loaded
a module that is a MRO plugin.  See <a href="mro.html">mro</a> and <a href="perlmroapi.html">perlmroapi</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-negative-number-(%25s)-in-chr"></a><strong>Invalid negative number (%s) in chr</strong>
<p>(W utf8) You passed a negative number to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr.html">chr</a></code>.  Negative numbers are
not valid characters numbers, so it return the Unicode replacement

</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Invalid [] range "%s" in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) The range specified in a character class had a minimum character
greater than the maximum character.  One possibility is that you forgot the

</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-range-%22%25s%22-in-transliteration-operator"></a><strong>Invalid range "%s" in transliteration operator</strong>
<p>(F) The range specified in the tr/// or y/// operator had a minimum
character greater than the maximum character.  See <a href="perlop.html">perlop</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-separator-character-%25s-in-attribute-list"></a><strong>Invalid separator character %s in attribute list</strong>
<p>(F) Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between the
elements of an attribute list.  If the previous attribute had a
parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was terminated too soon.
See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-separator-character-%25s-in-PerlIO-layer-specification-%25s"></a><strong>Invalid separator character %s in PerlIO layer specification %s</strong>
<p>(W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl I/O system, something other
than a colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list.
If the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that

</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-strict-version-format-(%25s)"></a><strong>Invalid strict version format (%s)</strong>
<p>(F) A version number did not meet the "strict" criteria for versions.
A "strict" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three components.
The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
See the <a href="version.html">version</a> module for more details on allowed version formats.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-type-'%25s'-in-%25s"></a><strong>Invalid type '%s' in %s</strong>
<p>(F) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
<p>(W) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type but used to be
silently ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-version-format-(%25s)"></a><strong>Invalid version format (%s)</strong>
<p>(F) A version number did not meet the "lax" criteria for versions.
A "lax" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v-string.  If the v-string has fewer than three components, it
must have a leading 'v' character.  Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a
trailing "alpha" component separated by an underscore character
after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.  The parenthesized
text indicates which criteria were not met.  See the <a href="version.html">version</a> module
for more details on allowed version formats.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Invalid-version-object"></a><strong>Invalid version object</strong>
<p>(F) The internal structure of the version object was invalid.
Perhaps the internals were modified directly in some way or
an arbitrary reference was blessed into the "version" class.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="ioctl-is-not-implemented"></a><strong>ioctl is not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement ioctl(), which is pretty
strange for a machine that supports C.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="ioctl()-on-unopened-%25s"></a><strong>ioctl() on unopened %s</strong>
<p>(W unopened) You tried ioctl() on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="IO-layers-(like-'%25s')-unavailable"></a><strong>IO layers (like '%s') unavailable</strong>
<p>(F) Your Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and therefore
you cannot use IO layers.  To have PerlIO, Perl must be configured
with 'useperlio'.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aatmark-not-implemented-on-this-architecture"></a><strong>IO::Socket::atmark not implemented on this architecture</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't implement the sockatmark() functionality,
neither as a system call nor an ioctl call (SIOCATMARK).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%24*-is-no-longer-supported"></a><strong>$* is no longer supported</strong>
<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable <pre>
<span class="i">$*</span></code>
, deprecated in older
perls, has been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no longer supported.  In
previous versions of perl the use of <pre>
<span class="i">$*</span></code>
 enabled or disabled multi-line
matching within a string.</p>
<p>Instead of using <pre>
<span class="i">$*</span></code>
 you should use the <code class="inline">/m</code> (and maybe <code class="inline">/s</code>) regexp
modifiers.  You can enable <code class="inline">/m</code> for a lexical scope (even a whole file)
with <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;/m&#39;</span></code>
.  (In older versions: when <pre>
<span class="i">$*</span></code>
 was set to a true value
then all regular expressions behaved as if they were written using <code class="inline">/m</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%24%23-is-no-longer-supported"></a><strong>$# is no longer supported</strong>
<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable <pre>
<span class="i">$#</span></code>
, deprecated in older
perls, has been removed as of 5.9.3 and is no longer supported.  You
should use the printf/sprintf functions instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%25s'-is-not-a-code-reference"></a><strong>'%s' is not a code reference</strong>
<p>(W overload) The second (fourth, sixth, ...) argument of
overload::constant needs to be a code reference.  Either
an anonymous subroutine, or a reference to a subroutine.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%25s'-is-not-an-overloadable-type"></a><strong>'%s' is not an overloadable type</strong>
<p>(W overload) You tried to overload a constant type the overload package is

<a href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="leaving-effective-%25s-failed"></a><strong>leaving effective %s failed</strong>
<p>(F) While under the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="length%2fcode-after-end-of-string-in-unpack"></a><strong>length/code after end of string in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) While unpacking, the string buffer was already used up when an unpack
length/code combination tried to obtain more data.  This results in
an undefined value for the length.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="length()-used-on-%25s"></a><strong>length() used on %s</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You used length() on either an array or a hash when you
probably wanted a count of the items.</p>
<p>Array size can be obtained by doing:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/scalar.html">scalar</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The number of items in a hash can be obtained by doing:</p>

</li>
<li><a id="Lexing-code-attempted-to-stuff-non-Latin-1-character-into-Latin-1-input"></a><strong>Lexing code attempted to stuff non-Latin-1 character into Latin-1 input</strong>
<p>(F) An extension is attempting to insert text into the current parse
(using <a href="perlapi.html#lex_stuff_pvn">lex_stuff_pvn</a> or similar), but tried to insert a character that
couldn't be part of the current input.  This is an inherent pitfall
of the stuffing mechanism, and one of the reasons to avoid it.  Where
it is necessary to stuff, stuffing only plain ASCII is recommended.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Lexing-code-internal-error-(%25s)"></a><strong>Lexing code internal error (%s)</strong>
<p>(F) Lexing code supplied by an extension violated the lexer's API in a
detectable way.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="listen()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>listen() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/listen.html">listen</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="List-form-of-piped-open-not-implemented"></a><strong>List form of piped open not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) On some platforms, notably Windows, the three-or-more-arguments
form of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a></code> does not support pipes, such as <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$pipe</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;|-&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">@args</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

 form instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="localtime(%25f)-too-large"></a><strong>localtime(%f) too large</strong>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> with a number that was larger
than it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> probably returned the
wrong date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="localtime(%25f)-too-small"></a><strong>localtime(%f) too small</strong>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> with a number that was smaller
than it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> probably returned the

</li>
<li><a id="Lookbehind-longer-than-%25d-not-implemented-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Lookbehind longer than %d not implemented in regex m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) There is currently a limit on the length of string which lookbehind can
handle.  This restriction may be eased in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Lost-precision-when-%25s-%25f-by-1"></a><strong>Lost precision when %s %f by 1</strong>
<p>(W imprecision) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one
is too large for the underlying floating point representation to store
accurately, hence the target of <pre>
++</code>
 or <pre>
--</code>
 is unchanged.  Perl issues this
warning because it has already switched from integers to floating point
when values are too large for integers, and now even floating point is
insufficient.  You may wish to switch to using <a href="Math/BigInt.html">Math::BigInt</a> explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="lstat()-on-filehandle%25s"></a><strong>lstat() on filehandle%s</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle.  What did you mean
by that?  lstat() makes sense only on filenames.  (Perl did a fstat()
instead on the filehandle.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="lvalue-attribute-%25s-already-defined-subroutine"></a><strong>lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine</strong>
<p>(W misc) Although <a href="attributes.html">attributes.pm</a> allows this, turning the lvalue
attribute on or off on a Perl subroutine that is already defined
does not always work properly.  It may or may not do what you
want, depending on what code is inside the subroutine, with exact
details subject to change between Perl versions.  Only do this
if you really know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="lvalue-attribute-ignored-after-the-subroutine-has-been-defined"></a><strong>lvalue attribute ignored after the subroutine has been defined</strong>
<p>(W misc) Using the <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="w">lvalue</span></code>
 declarative syntax to make a Perl
subroutine an lvalue subroutine after it has been defined is
not permitted.  To make the subroutine an lvalue subroutine,
add the lvalue attribute to the definition, or put the <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-integer-in-%5b%5d-in-unpack"></a><strong>Malformed integer in [] in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) Between the brackets enclosing a numeric repeat count only digits
are permitted.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-PERLLIB_PREFIX"></a><strong>Malformed PERLLIB_PREFIX</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to OS/2.  PERLLIB_PREFIX should be of the form</p>
<pre>
    <span class="w">prefix1</span><span class="sc">;</span><span class="w">prefix2</span></pre>
<p>or
    prefix1 prefix2</p>
<p>with nonempty prefix1 and prefix2.  If <pre>
<span class="w">prefix1</span></code>
 is indeed a prefix of
a builtin library search path, prefix2 is substituted.  The error may
appear if components are not found, or are too long.  See
"PERLLIB_PREFIX" in <a href="perlos2.html">perlos2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-prototype-for-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.  The
syntax of function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for
obvious errors like invalid characters.  A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-character-(%25s)"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)</strong>
<p>(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with UTF-8
encoding rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag on.</p>
<p>One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that
you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example legacy
8-bit data).  To guard against this, you can use Encode::decode_utf8.</p>
<p>If you use the <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">UTF</span>-<span class="n">8</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte
sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
, the flag is
set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error
message.</p>
<p>See also <a href="Encode.html#Handling-Malformed-Data">Handling Malformed Data in Encode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-character-immediately-after-'%25s'"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 character immediately after '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) You said <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code>
, but the program file doesn't comply with UTF-8
encoding rules.  The message prints out the properly encoded characters
just before the first bad one.  If <pre>
<span class="w">utf8</span></code>
 warnings are enabled, a
warning is generated that gives more details about the type of
malformation.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-returned-by-%5cN%7b%25s%7d-immediately-after-'%25s'"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 returned by \N{%s} immediately after '%s'</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-'%25c'-format-in-unpack"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 string in '%c' format in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to unpack something that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding
rules and perl was unable to guess how to make more progress.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-pack"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 string in pack</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to pack something that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding

</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-unpack"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-8 string in unpack</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Malformed-UTF-16-surrogate"></a><strong>Malformed UTF-16 surrogate</strong>
<p>(F) Perl thought it was reading UTF-16 encoded character data but while
doing it Perl met a malformed Unicode surrogate.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-matches-null-string-many-times-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>%s matches null string many times in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(W regexp) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  The &lt;-- HERE
shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Maximal-count-of-pending-signals-(%25u)-exceeded"></a><strong>Maximal count of pending signals (%u) exceeded</strong>
<p>(F) Perl aborted due to too high a number of signals pending.  This
usually indicates that your operating system tried to deliver signals
too fast (with a very high priority), starving the perl process from
resources it would need to reach a point where it can process signals
safely.  (See <a href="perlipc.html#Deferred-Signals-(Safe-Signals)">Deferred Signals (Safe Signals) in perlipc</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22%25s%22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><strong>"%s" may clash with future reserved word</strong>
<p>(W) This warning may be due to running a perl5 script through a perl4
interpreter, especially if the word that is being warned about is
"use" or "my".</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%25'-may-not-be-used-in-pack"></a><strong>'%' may not be used in pack</strong>
<p>(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, because the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other way.
See <a href="functions/unpack.html">unpack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Method-for-operation-%25s-not-found-in-package-%25s-during-blessing"></a><strong>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during blessing</strong>

<p>(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have been caused
by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Misplaced-_-in-number"></a><strong>Misplaced _ in number</strong>
<p>(W syntax) An underscore (underbar) in a numeric constant did not
separate two digits.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-argument-in-%25s"></a><strong>Missing argument in %s</strong>
<p>(W uninitialized) A printf-type format required more arguments than were

</li>
<li><a id="Missing-argument-to--%25c"></a><strong>Missing argument to -%c</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must follow

</li>
<li><a id="Missing-braces-on-%5cN%7b%7d-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Missing braces on \N{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">charname</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 within
double-quotish context.  This can also happen when there is a space
(or comment) between the <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 and the <code class="inline">{</code> in a regex with the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier.
This modifier does not change the requirement that the brace immediately
follow the <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-braces-on-%5co%7b%7d"></a><strong>Missing braces on \o{}</strong>
<p>(F) A <pre>
\<span class="w">o</span></code>
 must be followed immediately by a <code class="inline">{</code> in double-quotish context.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-comma-after-first-argument-to-%25s-function"></a><strong>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</strong>
<p>(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
"indirect object" before the argument list, this ain't one of them.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-command-in-piped-open"></a><strong>Missing command in piped open</strong>
<p>(W pipe) You used the <pre>

 construction, but the command was missing or
blank.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-control-char-name-in-%5cc"></a><strong>Missing control char name in \c</strong>
<p>(F) A double-quoted string ended with "\c", without the required control
character name.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-name-in-%22%25s-sub%22"></a><strong>Missing name in "%s sub"</strong>
<p>(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that
they have a name with which they can be found.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-%24-on-loop-variable"></a><strong>Missing $ on loop variable</strong>
<p>(F) Apparently you've been programming in <strong>csh</strong> too much.  Variables
are always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it
can vary from one line to the next.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Missing-operator-before-%25s%3f)"></a><strong>(Missing operator before %s?)</strong>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Often the missing operator is a comma.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-right-brace-on-%5c%25c%7b%7d-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Missing right brace on \%c{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) Missing right brace in <pre>
\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, <pre>
\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, or <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-right-brace-on-%5cN%7b%7d-or-unescaped-left-brace-after-%5cN"></a><strong>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</strong>
<p>(F) <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 has two meanings.</p>
<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name.  Thus <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASTERISK</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is another way of writing <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped <pre>
<span class="i">*</span></code>
 does.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for <code class="inline">[^\n]</code>, and like <code class="inline">.</code> but is not affected by the <code class="inline">/s</code> regex modifier.)</p>
<p>This can lead to some ambiguities.  When <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as <pre>
\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
<code class="inline">\N{</code> and a matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p>
<p>However, if there is no matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl doesn't know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if <code class="inline">[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code class="inline">\N\{</code></p>
</li>
<li><a id="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a><strong>Missing right curly or square bracket</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones.  As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you
were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line%3f)"></a><strong>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</strong>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted"></a><strong>Modification of a read-only value attempted</strong>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>
<pre>
<a name="mod"></a>    sub <span class="m">mod</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>] = <span class="n">1</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="i">mod</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.</p>
<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a></code> loop <i>VAR</i> when <i>VAR</i>
is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$x</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$n</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>

</li>
<li><a id="Modification-of-non-creatable-array-value-attempted%2c-%25s"></a><strong>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.</p>

</li>
<li><a id="Module-name-required-with--%25c-option"></a><strong>Module name required with -%c option</strong>
<p>(F) The <pre>

you omitted the name of the module.  Consult <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> for full details
about <pre>
-M</code>
 and <code class="inline">-m</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="More-than-one-argument-to-'%25s'-open"></a><strong>More than one argument to '%s' open</strong>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a></code> function has been asked to open multiple files.  This
can happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that takes a
list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a piped open mode.
See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a> for details.</p>

<li><a id="msg%25s-not-implemented"></a><strong>msg%s not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.</p>

.
They're written like <pre>
<span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span>][<span class="n">2</span>][<span class="n">3</span>]</code>
, as in C.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%2f'-must-follow-a-numeric-type-in-unpack"></a><strong>'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not
follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22my-sub%22-not-yet-implemented"></a><strong>"my sub" not yet implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don't try

</li>
<li><a id="%22my%22-variable-%25s-can't-be-in-a-package"></a><strong>"my" variable %s can't be in a package</strong>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.</p>

<p>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our.html">our</a></code> declaration is
provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so $c, @c,
%c, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.</p>

marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) The new (5.12) meaning of <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 as <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> is not valid in a bracketed
character class, for the same reason that <code class="inline">.</code> in a character class loses
its specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not
what you want.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%5cN%7bNAME%7d-must-be-resolved-by-the-lexer-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
backslash in double-quotish:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N{SPACE}&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span>
    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span>
    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="q">/${re}{SPACE}/</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></pre>
<p>It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and it
doesn't work here.  Instead use the solution above.</p>
<p>Finally, the message also can happen under the <code class="inline">/x</code> regex modifier when the
<pre>
\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is separated by spaces from the <code class="inline">{</code>, in which case, remove the spaces.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">/\N {SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span>
    <span class="q">/\N{SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span></pre>

<p>(F) Within <code class="inline">(?[   ])</code>, all constants interpreted as octal need to be
exactly 3 digits long.  This helps catch some ambiguities.  If your
constant is too short, add leading zeros, like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?[ [ \078 ] ])     # Syntax error!</li><li> (?[ [ \0078 ] ])    # Works</li><li> (?[ [ \007 8 ] ])   # Clearer</li></ol></div><p>The maximum number this construct can express is <pre>
\<span class="n">777</span></code>
.  If you
need a larger one, you need to use <a href="perlrebackslash.html#Octal-escapes">\o{}</a>
instead.  If you meant two separate things, you need to separate them</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?[ [ \7776 ] ])        # Syntax error!</li><li> (?[ [ \o{7776} ] ])     # One meaning</li><li> (?[ [ \777 6 ] ])       # Another meaning</li><li> (?[ [ \777 \006 ] ])    # Still another</li></ol></div></li>
<li><a id="Negative-'%2f'-count-in-unpack"></a><strong>Negative '/' count in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
negative.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Negative-length"></a><strong>Negative length</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer
length that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Negative-offset-to-vec-in-lvalue-context"></a><strong>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</strong>
<p>(F) When <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/vec.html">vec</a></code> is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Nested-quantifiers-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses.
So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.  The &lt;-- HERE shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</p>
<p>Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, <pre>
<span class="i">*?</span></code>
, <code class="inline">+?</code>, and
<pre>
<span class="q">??</span></code>
 appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-never-introduced"></a><strong>%s never introduced</strong>
<p>(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of
scope before it could possibly have been used.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="next%3a%3amethod%2fnext%3a%3acan%2fmaybe%3a%3anext%3a%3amethod-cannot-find-enclosing-method"></a><strong>next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing method</strong>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> needs to be called within the context of a
real method in a real package, and it could not find such a context.
See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-%25s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a><strong>No %s allowed while running setuid</strong>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-code-specified-for--%25c"></a><strong>No code specified for -%c</strong>
<p>(F) Perl's <strong>-e</strong> and <strong>-E</strong> command-line options require an argument.  If
you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate
argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    perl -e ""</li><li>    perl -e0</li><li>    perl -e1</li></ol></div></li>
<li><a id="No-comma-allowed-after-%25s"></a><strong>No comma allowed after %s</strong>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is
not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported
a constant to your name space with <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating
system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did
use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
please see <a href="functions/use.html">use</a> and <a href="functions/import.html">import</a>.  While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier
it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in
the constants of the symbol import list of <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> or in the
constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a><strong>No command into which to pipe on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-DB%3a%3aDB-routine-defined"></a><strong>No DB::DB routine defined</strong>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <strong>-d</strong> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <pre>
<span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-dbm-on-this-machine"></a><strong>No dbm on this machine</strong>
<p>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See <a href="SDBM_File.html">SDBM_File</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-DB%3a%3asub-routine-defined"></a><strong>No DB::sub routine defined</strong>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <strong>-d</strong> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <pre>
<span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a <pre>
<span class="w">DB::sub</span></code>
 routine to be called at the beginning
of each ordinary subroutine call.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-directory-specified-for--I"></a><strong>No directory specified for -I</strong>
<p>(F) The <strong>-I</strong> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the
<i>same</i> argument.  Use <strong>-Ilib</strong>, for instance.  <strong>-I lib</strong> won't work.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-error-file-after-2%3e-or-2%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-group-ending-character-'%25c'-found-in-template"></a><strong>No group ending character '%c' found in template</strong>
<p>(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its
matching counterpart.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-input-file-after-%3c-on-command-line"></a><strong>No input file after &lt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the
name of the file from which to read data for stdin.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-next%3a%3amethod-'%25s'-found-for-%25s"></a><strong>No next::method '%s' found for %s</strong>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> found no further instances of this method name
in the remaining packages of the MRO of this class.  If you don't want
it throwing an exception, use <pre>
<span class="w">maybe::next::method</span></code>

or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::can</a></code>.  See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22no%22-not-allowed-in-expression"></a><strong>"no" not allowed in expression</strong>
<p>(F) The "no" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and
returns no useful value.  See <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-output-file-after-%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No output file after &gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-output-file-after-%3e-or%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No output file after &gt; or&gt;&gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-package-name-allowed-for-variable-%25s-in-%22our%22"></a><strong>No package name allowed for variable %s in "our"</strong>
<p>(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in "our"
declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing
semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-Perl-script-found-in-input"></a><strong>No Perl script found in input</strong>
<p>(F) You called <pre>
<span class="w">perl</span> -x</code>
, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word "perl".</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-setregid-available"></a><strong>No setregid available</strong>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setregid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-setreuid-available"></a><strong>No setreuid available</strong>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setreuid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-such-class-field-%22%25s%22-in-variable-%25s-of-type-%25s"></a><strong>No such class field "%s" in variable %s of type %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed
variable but that key is not allowed by the package of the same type.
The indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the
<a href="fields.html">fields</a> pragma.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-such-class-%25s"></a><strong>No such class %s</strong>
<p>(F) You provided a class qualifier in a "my", "our" or "state"
declaration, but this class doesn't exist at this point in your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-such-hook%3a-%25s"></a><strong>No such hook: %s</strong>
<p>(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl.
Currently, Perl accepts <pre>
<span class="w">__DIE__</span></code>
 and <pre>
<span class="w">__WARN__</span></code>
 as valid signal hooks.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-such-pipe-open"></a><strong>No such pipe open</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="No-such-signal%3a-SIG%25s"></a><strong>No such signal: SIG%s</strong>
<p>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was
not recognized.  Say <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal
names on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-CODE-reference"></a><strong>Not a CODE reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-GLOB-reference"></a><strong>Not a GLOB reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "typeglob" (that is, a
symbol table entry that looks like <pre>
<span class="i">*foo</span></code>
), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out what
kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-HASH-reference"></a><strong>Not a HASH reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a
reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-an-ARRAY-reference"></a><strong>Not an ARRAY reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-an-unblessed-ARRAY-reference"></a><strong>Not an unblessed ARRAY reference</strong>
<p>(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/shift.html">shift</a></code> or
another array function.  These only accept unblessed array references
or arrays beginning explicitly with <pre>
<span class="i">@</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a><strong>Not a SCALAR reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-subroutine-reference"></a><strong>Not a subroutine reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-a-subroutine-reference-in-overload-table"></a><strong>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</strong>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-enough-arguments-for-%25s"></a><strong>Not enough arguments for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Not-enough-format-arguments"></a><strong>Not enough format arguments</strong>
<p>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
supplied.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s%3a-not-found"></a><strong>%s: not found</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="no-UTC-offset-information%3b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a><strong>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name
<i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which
need to be added to UTC to get local time.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Non-hex-character-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Non-hex character in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F)
In a regular expression, there was a non-hexadecimal character where
a hex one was expected, like</p>
<pre>
 <span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[ [ \xDG ] ])</span>
 <span class="q"> (?</span><span class="s">[</span> <span class="s">[</span> \<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">DEKA</span><span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">]</span> <span class="s">]</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Non-octal-character-'%25c'.--Resolved-as-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Non-octal character '%c'.  Resolved as "%s"</strong>
<p>(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character was
unexpectedly encountered that isn't octal.  The resulting value
is as indicated.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Non-octal-character-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Non-octal character in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F)
In a regular expression, there was a non-octal character where
an octal one was expected, like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?[ [ \o{1278} ] ])</li></ol></div></li>
<li><a id="Non-string-passed-as-bitmask"></a><strong>Non-string passed as bitmask</strong>
<p>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to select().
Use the vec() function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select.  See <a href="functions/select.html">select</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="(%3f%5b...%5d)-not-valid-in-locale-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>(?[...]) not valid in locale in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F)
<code class="inline">(?[...])</code> cannot be used within the scope of a <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
 or
with an <code class="inline">/l</code> regular expression modifier, as that would require
deferring to run-time the calculation of what it should evaluate to, and
it is regex compile-time only.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Null-filename-used"></a><strong>Null filename used</strong>
<p>(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many
machines that means the current directory!  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="NULL-OP-IN-RUN"></a><strong>NULL OP IN RUN</strong>
<p>(S debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null opcode
pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Null-picture-in-formline"></a><strong>Null picture in formline</strong>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Null-realloc"></a><strong>Null realloc</strong>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="NULL-regexp-argument"></a><strong>NULL regexp argument</strong>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="NULL-regexp-parameter"></a><strong>NULL regexp parameter</strong>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Number-too-long"></a><strong>Number too long</strong>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. "1e6" instead of
"1_000_000").</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Number-with-no-digits"></a><strong>Number with no digits</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like
a number.  This happens, for example with <pre>
\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, with no number between
the braces.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22my-%25s%22-used-in-sort-comparison"></a><strong>"my %s" used in sort comparison</strong>
<p>(W syntax) The package variables $a and $b are used for sort comparisons.
You used $a or $b in as an operand to the <pre>
&lt;=&gt;</code>
 or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/cmp.html">cmp</a></code> operator inside a
sort comparison block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a
lexical variable.  Either qualify the sort variable with the package
name, or rename the lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Octal-number-%3e-037777777777-non-portable"></a><strong>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Odd-number-of-arguments-for-overload%3a%3aconstant"></a><strong>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</strong>
<p>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
arguments.  The arguments should come in pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Odd-number-of-elements-in-anonymous-hash"></a><strong>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</strong>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a><strong>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</strong>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Offset-outside-string"></a><strong>Offset outside string</strong>
<p>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation
with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to
imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will
take place when going past the end of the string when either
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysread.html">sysread()</a></code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened
for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour
with real files).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s()-on-unopened-%25s"></a><strong>%s() on unopened %s</strong>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was
never initialized.  You need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket()
call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="-%25s-on-unopened-filehandle-%25s"></a><strong>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</strong>

<p>(W utf8) You tried to open a reference to a scalar for read or append
where the scalar contained code points over 0xFF.  In-memory files
model on-disk files and can only contain bytes.</p>

<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Opening-dirhandle-%25s-also-as-a-file"></a><strong>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</strong>
<p>(D io, deprecated) You used open() to associate a filehandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Opening-filehandle-%25s-also-as-a-directory"></a><strong>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</strong>
<p>(D io, deprecated) You used opendir() to associate a dirhandle to

<p>(F)
You wrote something like</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?[ \p{Digit} \p{Thai} ])</li></ol></div><p>There are two operands, but no operator giving how you want to combine
them.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Operation-%22%25s%22%3a-no-method-found%2c-%25s"></a><strong>Operation "%s": no method found, %s</strong>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless
the <pre>
<span class="w">fallback</span></code>
 overloading key is specified to be true.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Operation-%22%25s%22-returns-its-argument-for-non-Unicode-code-point-0x%25X"></a><strong>Operation "%s" returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</strong>
<p>(S utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do
is not defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>
<p>If the operation shown is "ToFold", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;non_unicode&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Operation-%22%25s%22-returns-its-argument-for-UTF-16-surrogate-U%2b%25X"></a><strong>Operation "%s" returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</strong>
<p>(S utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use of
surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but semantics
are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do
nothing for this operation.  Because the use of surrogates can be
dangerous, Perl warns.</p>
<p>If the operation shown is "ToFold", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-%25s"></a><strong>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say "*foo *foo" it will be interpreted as if you said
"*foo * 'foo'".</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22our%22-variable-%25s-redeclared"></a><strong>"our" variable %s redeclared</strong>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory!"></a><strong>Out of memory!</strong>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.</p>
<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <pre>
<span class="w">limit</span></code>
 and
<pre>
<span class="w">limit</span> <span class="w">datasize</span> <span class="w">n</span></code>
 (where <pre>
<span class="w">n</span></code>
 is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <pre>
<span class="w">ulimit</span> -<span class="w">a</span></code>

and <pre>
<span class="w">ulimit</span> -d <span class="w">n</span></code>
, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory-during-%25s-extend"></a><strong>Out of memory during %s extend</strong>
<p>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond
the largest possible memory allocation.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory-during-%22large%22-request-for-%25s"></a><strong>Out of memory during "large" request for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-%25s"></a><strong>Out of memory during request for %s</strong>
<p>(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <pre>
<span class="i">$^M</span></code>
 as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory-during-ridiculously-large-request"></a><strong>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</strong>
<p>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
<pre>
<span class="i">$arr</span>[<a class="l_k" href="functions/time.html">time</a>]</code>
 instead of <pre>
<span class="i">$arr</span>[<span class="i">$time</span>]</code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Out-of-memory-for-yacc-stack"></a><strong>Out of memory for yacc stack</strong>
<p>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but realloc() wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'.'-outside-of-string-in-pack"></a><strong>'.' outside of string in pack</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to a '.' in your template tried to move the working
position to before the start of the packed string being built.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%40'-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a><strong>'@' outside of string in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%40'-outside-of-string-with-malformed-UTF-8-in-unpack"></a><strong>'@' outside of string with malformed UTF-8 in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  The string being unpacked was also invalid
UTF-8.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="overload-arg-'%25s'-is-invalid"></a><strong>overload arg '%s' is invalid</strong>
<p>(W overload) The <a href="overload.html">overload</a> pragma was passed an argument it did not
recognize.  Did you mistype an operator?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Overloaded-dereference-did-not-return-a-reference"></a><strong>Overloaded dereference did not return a reference</strong>
<p>(F) An object with an overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced,
but the overloaded operation did not return a reference.  See
<a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Overloaded-qr-did-not-return-a-REGEXP"></a><strong>Overloaded qr did not return a REGEXP</strong>
<p>(F) An object with a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr</a></code> overload was used as part of a match, but the
overloaded operation didn't return a compiled regexp.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-package-attribute-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word%3a-%25s"></a><strong>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</strong>
<p>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
package-specific handler.  That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
some day, even though it doesn't yet.  Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead.  See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="pack%2funpack-repeat-count-overflow"></a><strong>pack/unpack repeat count overflow</strong>
<p>(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows your
signed integers.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="page-overflow"></a><strong>page overflow</strong>
<p>(W io) A single call to write() produced more lines than can fit on a
page.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="panic%3a-%25s"></a><strong>panic: %s</strong>
<p>(P) An internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="panic%3a-attempt-to-call-%25s-in-%25s"></a><strong>panic: attempt to call %s in %s</strong>
<p>(P) One of the file test operators entered a code branch that calls
an ACL related-function, but that function is not available on this
platform.  Earlier checks mean that it should not be possible to
enter this branch on this platform.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="panic%3a-child-pseudo-process-was-never-scheduled"></a><strong>panic: child pseudo-process was never scheduled</strong>
<p>(P) A child pseudo-process in the ithreads implementation on Windows

</li>
<li><a id="panic%3a-gp_free-failed-to-free-glob-pointer"></a><strong>panic: gp_free failed to free glob pointer</strong>
<p>(P) The internal routine used to clear a typeglob's entries tried
repeatedly, but each time something re-created entries in the glob.
Most likely the glob contains an object with a reference back to
the glob and a destructor that adds a new object to the glob.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="panic%3a-INTERPCASEMOD%2c-%25s"></a><strong>panic: INTERPCASEMOD, %s</strong>

<p>(F) Your platform has very uncommon byte-order and integer size,
so it was not possible to set up some or all fixed-width byte-order
conversion functions.  This is only a problem when you're using the

<p>(F) The code you are trying to run has asked for a newer version of
Perl than you are running.  Perhaps <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="n">5.10</span></code>
 was written instead
of <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="n">5.010</span></code>
 or <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="v">v5.10</span></code>
.  Without the leading <pre>
<span class="w">v</span></code>
, the number is
interpreted as a decimal, with every three digits after the
decimal point representing a part of the version number.  So 5.10
is equivalent to v5.100.</p>

</li>
<li><a id="PERL_SH_DIR-too-long"></a><strong>PERL_SH_DIR too long</strong>

dead serious, fortunately: there is a "default locale" called "C" that
Perl can and will use, and the script will be run.  Before you really
fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each

<li><a id="Possible-attempt-to-put-comments-in-qw()-list"></a><strong>Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list</strong>
<p>(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated as
literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)</p>
<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@list</span> = <span class="q">qw(</span>
	<span class="q">a # a comment</span>
        <span class="q">b # another comment</span>
    <span class="q">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you should have written this:</p>

	<span class="q">a</span>
        <span class="q">b</span>
    <span class="q">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>If you really want comments, build your list the
old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@list</span> = <span class="s">(</span>
        <span class="q">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span>    <span class="c"># a comment</span>

    <span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Possible-attempt-to-separate-words-with-commas"></a><strong>Possible attempt to separate words with commas</strong>
<p>(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore
commas aren't needed to separate the items.  (You may have used
different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also
frequently used.)</p>
<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">qw! a, b, c !</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>which puts literal commas into some of the list items.  Write it without
commas if you don't want them to appear in your data:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="q">qw! a b c !</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a id="Possible-memory-corruption%3a-%25s-overflowed-3rd-argument"></a><strong>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</strong>
<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See <a href="functions/ioctl.html">ioctl</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Possible-precedence-problem-on-bitwise-%25c-operator"></a><strong>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator</strong>
<p>(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction
with a numeric comparison operator, like this :</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span> &amp; <span class="i">$y</span> == <span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> ... <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>This expression is actually equivalent to <pre>
<span class="i">$x</span> &amp; <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$y</span> == <span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, due to the
higher precedence of <pre>
==</code>
.  This is probably not what you want.  (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the
parentheses explicitly and write <pre>
<span class="i">$x</span> &amp; <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$y</span> == <span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Possible-unintended-interpolation-of-%24%5c-in-regex"></a><strong>Possible unintended interpolation of $\ in regex</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/$\/</a></code> in a regex.
The regex <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$\s+bar/m</a></code> translates to: match the word 'foo', the output
record separator (see <a href="perlvar.html#%24%5c">$\ in perlvar</a>) and the letter 's' (one time or more)
followed by the word 'bar'.</p>
<p>If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using 
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/${\}/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo${\}s+bar/</a></code>).</p>
<p>If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of the line
followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then you can use
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/$(?)\/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$(?)\s+bar/</a></code>).</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Possible-unintended-interpolation-of-%25s-in-string"></a><strong>Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string
but there was no array <pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span></code>
 in scope at the time.  If you wanted a
literal @foo, then write it as \@foo; otherwise find out what happened
to the array you apparently lost track of.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Precedence-problem%3a-open-%25s-should-be-open(%25s)"></a><strong>Precedence problem: open %s should be open(%s)</strong>

<p>because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and
list operators.  (The old open was a little of both.)  You must put
parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new "or" operator instead
of "||".</p>

</li>
<li><a id="%5cp%7b%7d-uses-Unicode-rules%2c-not-locale-rules"></a><strong>\p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules</strong>
<p>(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property
match (<pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">P</span></code>
), but the regular expression is also being told to
use the run-time locale, not Unicode.  Instead, use a POSIX character
class, which should know about the locale's rules.
(See <a href="perlrecharclass.html#POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes in perlrecharclass</a>.)</p>
<p>Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of
Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.  If the
locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the "GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI".  But in Unicode that code point means the
"MULTIPLICATION SIGN" instead, and <pre>
\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 always uses the Unicode
meaning.  That means that <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Alpha</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 won't match, but <code class="inline">[[:alpha:]]</code>
should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give
incorrect results.  An example is <pre>
\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Changes_When_Uppercased</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 which
is true for "LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS", but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
change when upper cased.</p>

<p>(W misc) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list
with an even number of elements (for assignment to a hash).  This

<p>(F) You used <pre>
\<span class="w">g0</span></code>

to capturing parentheses only with strictly positive integers
(normal backreferences) or with strictly negative integers (relative

<p>(F) You used something like <pre>
\<span class="n">7</span></code>
 in your regular expression, but there are
not at least seven sets of capturing parentheses in the expression.  If
you wanted to have the character with ordinal 7 inserted into the regular

</li>
<li><a id="Regexp-modifier-%22%2f%25c%22-may-not-appear-twice"></a><strong>Regexp modifier "/%c" may not appear twice</strong>
<p>(F syntax, regexp) The regular expression pattern had too many occurrences

<p>(F) Turning off the given modifier has the side effect of turning on
another one.  Perl currently doesn't allow this.  Reword the regular

</li>
<li><a id="Repeated-format-line-will-never-terminate-(~~-and-%40%23-incompatible)"></a><strong>Repeated format line will never terminate (~~ and @# incompatible)</strong>
<p>(F) Your format contains the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence and a

</li>
<li><a id="Replacement-list-is-longer-than-search-list"></a><strong>Replacement list is longer than search list</strong>
<p>(W misc) You have used a replacement list that is longer than the
search list.  So the additional elements in the replacement list
are meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'%25s'-resolved-to-'%5co%7b%25s%7d%25d'"></a><strong>'%s' resolved to '\o{%s}%d'</strong>
<p>(W misc, regexp)  You wrote something like <pre>
\<span class="n">08</span></code>
, or <pre>
\<span class="n">179</span></code>
 in a
double-quotish string.  All but the last digit is treated as a single
character, specified in octal.  The last digit is the next character in
the string.  To tell Perl that this is indeed what you want, you can use
the <pre>
\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span> <span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax, or use exactly three digits to specify the octal
for the character.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Reversed-%25s%3d-operator"></a><strong>Reversed %s= operator</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You wrote your assignment operator backwards.  The = must
always come last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="rewinddir()-attempted-on-invalid-dirhandle-%25s"></a><strong>rewinddir() attempted on invalid dirhandle %s</strong>
<p>(W io) The dirhandle you tried to do a rewinddir() on is either closed or not
really a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Scalars-leaked%3a-%25d"></a><strong>Scalars leaked: %d</strong>
<p>(S internal) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping
of scalars: not all scalar variables were deallocated by the time
Perl exited.  What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which
is of course bad, especially if the Perl program is intended to be
long-running.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Scalar-value-%40%25s%5b%25s%5d-better-written-as-%24%25s%5b%25s%5d"></a><strong>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that <pre>
<span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while <pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

<li><a id="Search-pattern-not-terminated"></a><strong>Search pattern not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}

Missing the leading <pre>
<span class="i">$</span></code>

<span class="i">$m</span></code>
 may cause this error.</p>
<p>Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i>
construct, not just the empty search pattern.  Therefore code written
in Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the // as the <i>defined-or</i> can be
misparsed by pre-5.9.0 Perls as a non-terminated search pattern.</p>

<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a <pre>

<p>The question mark is also used as part of the ternary operator (as in
<pre>
<span class="w">foo</span> ? <span class="n">0</span> <span class="co">:</span> <span class="n">1</span></code>
) leading to some ambiguous constructions being wrongly
parsed.  One way to disambiguate the parsing is to put parentheses around
the conditional expression, i.e. <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">)</span> ? <span class="n">0</span> <span class="co">:</span> <span class="n">1</span></code>

<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window
when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web.  The
actual error text varies widely from server to server.  The most
frequently-seen variants are "500 Server error", "Method (something)
not permitted", "Document contains no data", "Premature end of script
headers", and "Did not produce a valid header".</p>
<p><strong>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by
the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the
user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment
variables (like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't
in a location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or
less.  Please see the following for more information:</p>

</li>
<li><a id="setpgrp-can't-take-arguments"></a><strong>setpgrp can't take arguments</strong>
<p>(F) Your system has the setpgrp() from BSD 4.2, which takes no
arguments, unlike POSIX setpgid(), which takes a process ID and process
group ID.</p>

<a href="functions/setsockopt.html">setsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="shm%25s-not-implemented"></a><strong>shm%s not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) You don't have System V shared memory IPC on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="!%3d~-should-be-!~"></a><strong>!=~ should be !~</strong>
<p>(W syntax) The non-matching operator is !~, not !=~.  !=~ will be
interpreted as the != (numeric not equal) and ~ (1's complement)
operators: probably not what you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%3c%3e-should-be-quotes"></a><strong>&lt;&gt; should be quotes</strong>
<p>(F) You wrote <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&lt;file&gt;</span></code>
 when you should have written

.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%2f%25s%2f-should-probably-be-written-as-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>/%s/ should probably be written as "%s"</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/join.html">join</a></code>.  Perl will treat the true or false
result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string, which is
probably not what you had in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="shutdown()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>shutdown() on closed socket %s</strong>

superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="SIG%25s-handler-%22%25s%22-not-defined"></a><strong>SIG%s handler "%s" not defined</strong>
<p>(W signal) The signal handler named in %SIG doesn't, in fact, exist.
Perhaps you put it into the wrong package?</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Slab-leaked-from-cv-%25p"></a><strong>Slab leaked from cv %p</strong>
<p>(S) If you see this message, then something is seriously wrong with the
internal bookkeeping of op trees.  An op tree needed to be freed after
a compilation error, but could not be found, so it was leaked instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="sleep(%25u)-too-large"></a><strong>sleep(%u) too large</strong>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sleep.html">sleep</a></code> with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sleep.html">sleep</a></code> probably slept for less time than

</li>
<li><a id="Smartmatch-is-experimental"></a><strong>Smartmatch is experimental</strong>
<p>(S experimental::smartmatch) This warning is emitted if you
use the smartmatch (<pre>

) operator.  This is currently an experimental
feature, and its details are subject to change in future releases of
Perl.  Particularly, its current behavior is noticed for being
unnecessarily complex and unintuitive, and is very likely to be
overhauled.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Smart-matching-a-non-overloaded-object-breaks-encapsulation"></a><strong>Smart matching a non-overloaded object breaks encapsulation</strong>
<p>(F) You should not use the <pre>

the smart match.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="sort-is-now-a-reserved-word"></a><strong>sort is now a reserved word</strong>
<p>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Sort-subroutine-didn't-return-single-value"></a><strong>Sort subroutine didn't return single value</strong>
<p>(F) A sort comparison subroutine written in XS must return exactly one
item.  See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Source-filters-apply-only-to-byte-streams"></a><strong>Source filters apply only to byte streams</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by loading a
source filter module) within a string passed to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a></code>.  This is
not permitted under the <pre>
<span class="w">unicode_eval</span></code>

</li>
<li><a id="splice()-offset-past-end-of-array"></a><strong>splice() offset past end of array</strong>
<p>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of
the array passed to splice().  Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it.  If this isn't what you want,
try explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = $offset.
See <a href="functions/splice.html">splice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Split-loop"></a><strong>Split loop</strong>
<p>(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn't
iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.)  See <a href="functions/split.html">split</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Statement-unlikely-to-be-reached"></a><strong>Statement unlikely to be reached</strong>
<p>(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a
die().  This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns
unless there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system()
instead, which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in
a block by itself.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22state%22-variable-%25s-can't-be-in-a-package"></a><strong>"state" variable %s can't be in a package</strong>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make

local() if you want to localize a package variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22state-%25s%22-used-in-sort-comparison"></a><strong>"state %s" used in sort comparison</strong>

You used $a or $b in as an operand to the <pre>

<p>(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by importation
stubs.  Stubs should never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to

</li>
<li><a id="Subroutine-%22%26%25s%22-is-not-available"></a><strong>Subroutine "&amp;%s" is not available</strong>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical
subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,</p>
<pre>
<a name="a"></a><a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> \<span class="i">&amp;a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current the "a" sub,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the
following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now
been created and is live:</p>
<pre>
<a name="a"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;sub f { \&amp;a }&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre>
<a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span>
<a name="a"></a>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;\&amp;a&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently
being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</p>

<li><a id="%22%25s%22-subroutine-%26%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><strong>"%s" subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s</strong>
<p>(W misc) A "my" or "state" subroutine has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to
the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.
Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Subroutine-%25s-redefined"></a><strong>Subroutine %s redefined</strong>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say</p>

<li><a id="Substitution-loop"></a><strong>Substitution loop</strong>
<p>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a substitution

<p>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the

<p>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most
two branches (the if-clause and the else-clause).  If you want one or
both to contain alternation, such as using <pre>
<span class="w">this</span>|<span class="w">that</span>|<span class="w">other</span></code>
, enclose
it in clustering parentheses:</p>

    <span class="w">A</span> <span class="w">closing</span> <span class="w">quote</span> <span class="w">is</span> <span class="w">missing</span>.</pre>
<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <strong>-w</strong>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<pre>
<span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="syntax-error-at-line-%25d%3a-'%25s'-unexpected"></a><strong>syntax error at line %d: '%s' unexpected</strong>

<p>(F) You tried to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a></code> to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach.  Perl is doing you a favor by refusing.</p>
</li>

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains
the <strong>-T</strong> option (or the <strong>-t</strong> option), but Perl was not invoked with

Perl discovers a <strong>-T</strong> in a script, it's too late to properly taint
everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be
fixed by editing the #! line so that the <strong>-%c</strong> option is a part of
Perl's first argument: e.g. change <pre>

<p>In the case of <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-m</strong>, this is an error because those options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> pragma instead.</p>
<p>The <strong>-C</strong> option only works if it is specified on the command line as

<p>(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument
to be a hard reference to data of the specified type.  Overloading is
ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but
nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>

<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (?[ ( \p{Digit} + ) ])</li></ol></div><p>The <pre>

 is out-of-place.  Something apparently was supposed to be

<li><a id="Unicode-non-character-U%2b%25X-is-illegal-for-open-interchange"></a><strong>Unicode non-character U+%X is illegal for open interchange</strong>
<p>(S utf8, nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are
defined by the Unicode standard to be non-characters.  Those are
legal codepoints, but are reserved for internal use; so, applications
shouldn't attempt to exchange them.  If you know what you are doing
you can turn off this warning by <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;nonchar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

</li>
<li><a id="Unicode-surrogate-U%2b%25X-is-illegal-in-UTF-8"></a><strong>Unicode surrogate U+%X is illegal in UTF-8</strong>
<p>(S utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-charname-'%25s'"></a><strong>Unknown charname '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) The name you used inside <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is unknown to Perl.  Check the
spelling.  You can say <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">charnames</span> <span class="q">&quot;:loose&quot;</span></code>
 to not have to be
so precise about spaces, hyphens, and capitalization on standard Unicode
names.  (Any custom aliases that have been created must be specified
exactly, regardless of whether <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="w">loose</span></code>
 is used or not.)  This error may
also happen if the <pre>
\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is not in the scope of the corresponding
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">charnames</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-error"></a><strong>Unknown error</strong>
<p>(P) Perl was about to print an error message in <pre>
<span class="i">$@</span></code>
, but the <pre>
<span class="i">$@</span></code>
 variable
did not exist, even after an attempt to create it.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-open()-mode-'%25s'"></a><strong>Unknown open() mode '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) The second argument of 3-argument open() is not among the list
of valid modes: <code class="inline">&lt;</code>, <code class="inline">&gt;</code>, <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-PerlIO-layer-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Unknown PerlIO layer "%s"</strong>
<p>(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O
system.  (Layers take care of transforming data between external and
internal representations.)  Note that some layers, such as <pre>
<span class="w">mmap</span></code>
,
are not supported in all environments.  If your program didn't
explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the
value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-process-%25x-sent-message-to-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl was reading values for %ENV before
iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the stream of
data Perl expected.  Someone's very confused, or perhaps trying to
subvert Perl's population of %ENV for nefarious purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-%22re%22-subpragma-'%25s'-(known-ones-are%3a-%25s)"></a><strong>Unknown "re" subpragma '%s' (known ones are: %s)</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-regex-modifier-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Unknown regex modifier "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter
of a regular expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier
flags for the regex.  One of the ones you specified is invalid.  One way
this can happen is if you didn't put in white space between the end of
the regex and a following alphanumeric operator:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> if ($a =~ /foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }</li></ol></div><p>The <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;a&quot;</span></code>
 is a valid modifier flag, but the <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;n&quot;</span></code>
 is not, and raises
this error.  Likely what was meant instead was:</p>
<pre>
 <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$a</span> =~ <span class="q">/foo/</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/and.html">and</a> <span class="i">$bar</span> == <span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> ... <span class="s">}</span></pre>

<p>(F) The condition part of a (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct
is not known.  The condition must be one of the following:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> (1) (2) ...        true if 1st, 2nd, etc., capture matched</li><li> (&lt;NAME&gt;) ('NAME')  true if named capture matched</li><li> (?=...)

<a href="perlre.html">perlre</a> for details on legal verb patterns.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unknown-warnings-category-'%25s'"></a><strong>Unknown warnings category '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) An error issued by the <pre>
<span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.  You specified a warnings
category that is unknown to perl at this point.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to enable a warnings category registered by a
module (e.g. <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;File::Find&#39;</span></code>
), you must have loaded this

<p>(F) The brackets around a character class must match.  If you wish to
include a closing bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it
first.  The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the
problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unmatched-'%5b'-in-POSIX-class-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Unmatched '[' in POSIX class in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</strong>

You had something like this:</p>

<p>(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
expressions.  If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding
the matching parenthesis.  The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the
regular expression the problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unmatched-right-%25s-bracket"></a><strong>Unmatched right %s bracket</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening
ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket.  As a
general rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place
you were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unquoted-string-%22%25s%22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><strong>Unquoted string "%s" may clash with future reserved word</strong>
<p>(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a
reserved word.  It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it
somehow, or insert an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a
subroutine.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unrecognized-character-%25s%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-after-%25s-near-column-%25d"></a><strong>Unrecognized character %s; marked by &lt;-- HERE after %s near column %d</strong>
<p>(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character
in your Perl script (or eval) near the specified column.  Perhaps you tried 
to run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl program.</p>
</li>

this may change in a future version of Perl.  The &lt;-- HERE shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unrecognized-signal-name-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Unrecognized signal name "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You specified a signal name to the kill() function that was not
recognized.  Say <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal names
on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unrecognized-switch%3a--%25s--(-h-will-show-valid-options)"></a><strong>Unrecognized switch: -%s  (-h will show valid options)</strong>
<p>(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.  (If you
think you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's supplying the
bad switch on your behalf.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsuccessful-%25s-on-filename-containing-newline"></a><strong>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</strong>
<p>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that
operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline,
PROBABLY because you forgot to chomp() it off.  See <a href="functions/chomp.html">chomp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsupported-directory-function-%22%25s%22-called"></a><strong>Unsupported directory function "%s" called</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support opendir() and readdir().</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsupported-function-%25s"></a><strong>Unsupported function %s</strong>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently.
At least, Configure doesn't think so.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsupported-function-fork"></a><strong>Unsupported function fork</strong>
<p>(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.</p>
<p>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors
of Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not.  Try
changing the name you call Perl by to <pre>
<span class="w">perl_</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="w">perl__</span></code>
, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsupported-script-encoding-%25s"></a><strong>Unsupported script encoding %s</strong>
<p>(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which
declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unsupported-socket-function-%22%25s%22-called"></a><strong>Unsupported socket function "%s" called</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Unterminated-attribute-list"></a><strong>Unterminated attribute list</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the

</li>
<li><a id="Unterminated-%3c%3e-operator"></a><strong>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting

not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>

<li><a id="Useless-use-of-'%5c'%3b-doesn't-escape-metacharacter-'%25c'"></a><strong>Useless use of '\'; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You wrote a regular expression pattern something like
one of these:</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li> m{ \x\{FF\} }x</li><li> m{foo\{1,3\}}</li><li> qr(foo\(bar\))</li><li> s[foo\[a-z\]bar][baz]</li></ol></div><p>The interior braces, square brackets, and parentheses are treated as

delimitted by <pre>
<span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
, or <pre>
<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which ordinarily are
metacharacters, and the delimiters are also used, paired, within the
interior of the pattern.  It is planned that a future Perl release will
change the meaning of constructs like these so that the backslashes
will have an effect, so remove them from your code.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Useless-use-of-%5cE"></a><strong>Useless use of \E</strong>
<p>(W misc) You have a \E in a double-quotish string without a <pre>
\<span class="w">U</span></code>
,
<pre>
\<span class="w">L</span></code>
 or <pre>
\<span class="w">Q</span></code>
 preceding it.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Useless-use-of-%25s-in-void-context"></a><strong>Useless use of %s in void context</strong>
<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you meant to say</p>
<pre>
    <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$array</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you should have said</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">$array</span> = <span class="s">[</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1
since they are often used in statements like</p>
<pre>
    <span class="n">1</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/while.html">while</a> <span class="i">sub_with_side_effects</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>

about.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Useless-use-of-%22re%22-pragma"></a><strong>Useless use of "re" pragma</strong>
<p>(W) You did <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Useless-use-of-sort-in-scalar-context"></a><strong>Useless use of sort in scalar context</strong>

futile.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Useless-use-of-%25s-with-no-values"></a><strong>Useless use of %s with no values</strong>

apart from the array, like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@x)</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unshift.html">unshift(@foo)</a></code>.  That won't
usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.  It's
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.  If so,
you can write it as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@tied_array,())</a></code> to avoid this warning.</p>

</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-chdir('')-or-chdir(undef)-as-chdir()-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of chdir('') or chdir(undef) as chdir() deprecated</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-%3a%3d-for-an-empty-attribute-list-is-not-allowed"></a><strong>Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed</strong>
<p>(F) The construction <pre>

 (applying an empty attribute list to <pre>

).
This construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax
error, so <pre>

</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-freed-value-in-iteration"></a><strong>Use of freed value in iteration</strong>
<p>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="i">@a</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">4</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span>

<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.
For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-*glob%7bFILEHANDLE%7d-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated</strong>

</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-%2fg-modifier-is-meaningless-in-split"></a><strong>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</strong>
<p>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code>

</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-method-%25s()-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/AUTOLOAD.html">AUTOLOAD</a></code>
subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <pre>
<span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <pre>
<span class="i">Foo::bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
), not as methods (e.g. <pre>
<span class="w">Foo</span><span class="w">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or
<pre>
<span class="i">$obj</span><span class="i">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/AUTOLOAD.html">AUTOLOAD</a></code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/AUTOLOAD.html">AUTOLOAD</a></code>s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/AUTOLOAD.html">AUTOLOAD</a></code> for non-methods from a base class
named <pre>
<span class="w">BaseClass</span></code>
, execute <pre>
<span class="i">*AUTOLOAD</span> = \<span class="i">&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</span></code>
 during
startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">@ISA</span> = <span class="q">qw(AutoLoader)</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 to
<pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span> <span class="q">&#39;AUTOLOAD&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

its behavior may change or even be removed in any future release of perl.
See the explanation under <a href="perlvar.html#%24_">$_ in perlvar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-%25s-on-a-handle-without-*-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You used <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tied.html">tied</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/untie.html">untie</a></code> on a scalar but that scalar
happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied.  If
you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a> <span class="i">*$handle</span></code>
.</p>
<p>This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was
no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to
untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.  If you see this
message, you must be using an older version.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-%3fPATTERN%3f-without-explicit-operator-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You have written something like <pre>
<span class="q">?\w?</span></code>
, for a regular
expression that matches only once.  Starting this term directly with
the question mark delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark
will be available for use in new operators in the future.  Write <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m?\w?</a></code>
instead, explicitly using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m</a></code> operator: the question mark delimiter
still invokes match-once behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-reference-%22%25s%22-as-array-index"></a><strong>Use of reference "%s" as array index</strong>
<p>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend
to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.</p>
<p>If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
<pre>
<span class="i">$array</span>[<span class="n">0</span>+<span class="i">$ref</span>]</code>
.  This warning is not given for overloaded objects,
however, because you can overload the numification and stringification
operators and then you presumably know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-state-%24_-is-experimental"></a><strong>Use of state $_ is experimental</strong>
<p>(S experimental::lexical_topic) Lexical $_ is an experimental feature and
its behavior may change or even be removed in any future release of perl.
See the explanation under <a href="perlvar.html#%24_">$_ in perlvar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-tainted-arguments-in-%25s-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</strong>
<p>(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system.html">system()</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec()</a></code> with multiple
arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed
but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your
arguments.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Use-of-uninitialized-value%25s"></a><strong>Use of uninitialized value%s</strong>
<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>
<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
anid the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program.  For example, <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;that $foo&quot;</span></code>
 is usually
optimized into <pre>
<span class="q">&quot;that &quot;</span> . <span class="i">$foo</span></code>
, and the warning will refer to the
<code class="inline">concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code class="inline">.</code> in
your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Using-a-hash-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
<pre>
<span class="i">%foo</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;bar&quot;</span>}</code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">%$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;hello&quot;</span>}</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.   It is now
deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Using-an-array-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Using an array as a reference is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
<pre>
<span class="i">@foo</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">23</span>]</code>
 or <pre>
<span class="i">@$ref</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">99</span>]</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to
allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  It is now deprecated,
and will be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>(W regexp) A charnames handler may return a sequence of more than one
character.  Currently all but the first one are discarded when used in
a regular expression pattern bracketed character class.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Using-!~-with-%25s-doesn't-make-sense"></a><strong>Using !~ with %s doesn't make sense</strong>
<p>(F) Using the <pre>

 operator with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///r</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr///r</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/y.html">y///r</a></code> is
currently reserved for future use, as the exact behaviour has not
been decided.  (Simply returning the boolean opposite of the
modified string is usually not particularly useful.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="UTF-16-surrogate-U%2b%25X"></a><strong>UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</strong>
<p>(S utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Value-of-%25s-can-be-%220%22%3b-test-with-defined()"></a><strong>Value of %s can be "0"; test with defined()</strong>
<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/each.html">each()</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/readdir.html">readdir()</a></code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of "0"; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a></code> operator.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Value-of-CLI-symbol-%22%25s%22-too-long"></a><strong>Value of CLI symbol "%s" too long</strong>
<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string
longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-available"></a><strong>Variable "%s" is not available</strong>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.)  For example,</p>
<pre>
<a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;sub f { $a }&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre>
<a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;$a&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-imported%25s"></a><strong>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</strong>
<p>(S misc) With "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</strong>
<p>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%22%25s%22-variable-%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><strong>"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</strong>
<p>(W misc) A "my", "our" or "state" variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope
or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Variable-syntax"></a><strong>Variable syntax</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Variable-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><strong>Variable "%s" will not stay shared</strong>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="vector-argument-not-supported-with-alpha-versions"></a><strong>vector argument not supported with alpha versions</strong>
<p>(S printf) The %vd (s)printf format does not support version objects
with alpha parts.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Verb-pattern-'%25s'-has-a-mandatory-argument-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE--in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Verb pattern '%s' has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE

<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument.  Supply an
argument or check that you are using the right verb.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Verb-pattern-'%25s'-may-not-have-an-argument-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE--in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>Verb pattern '%s' may not have an argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE

<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument.  Remove the 
argument or check that you are using the right verb.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Version-number-must-be-a-constant-number"></a><strong>Version number must be a constant number</strong>
<p>(P) The attempt to translate a <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">Module</span> <span class="w">n</span>.<span class="w">n</span> <span class="w">LIST</span></code>
 statement into
its equivalent <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/BEGIN.html">BEGIN</a></code> block found an internal inconsistency with
the version number.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Version-string-'%25s'-contains-invalid-data%3b-ignoring%3a-'%25s'"></a><strong>Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</strong>
<p>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
are being ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Warning%3a-something's-wrong"></a><strong>Warning: something's wrong</strong>
<p>(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/warn.html">warn</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <pre>
<span class="i">$@</span></code>
 was empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Warning%3a-unable-to-close-filehandle-%25s-properly"></a><strong>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</strong>
<p>(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on
the close().  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk
space.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Warning%3a-Use-of-%22%25s%22-without-parentheses-is-ambiguous"></a><strong>Warning: Use of "%s" without parentheses is ambiguous</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>but in actual fact, you got</p>
<pre>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">+5</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="when-is-experimental"></a><strong>when is experimental</strong>
<p>(S experimental::smartmatch) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/when.html">when</a></code> depends on smartmatch, which is
experimental.  Additionally, it has several special cases that may
not be immediately obvious, and their behavior may change or
even be removed in any future release of perl.
See the explanation under <a href="perlsyn.html#Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">Experimental Details on given and when in perlsyn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Wide-character-in-%25s"></a><strong>Wide character in %s</strong>
<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting
one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <pre>
<span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
 layer to the
output, e.g. <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a> <span class="w">STDOUT</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;:utf8&#39;</span></code>
.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <pre>
<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;utf8&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="open.html">open</a> and <a href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Within-%5b%5d-length-'%25c'-not-allowed"></a><strong>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</strong>
<p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <pre>
<span class="s">[</span><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span><span class="s">]</span></code>

only if <pre>
<span class="w">TEMPLATE</span></code>
 always matches the same amount of packed bytes that
can be determined from the template alone.  This is not possible if
it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length.  Redesign
the template.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="write()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><strong>write() on closed filehandle %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="%25s-%22%5cx%25X%22-does-not-map-to-Unicode"></a><strong>%s "\x%X" does not map to Unicode</strong>
<p>(F) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything
into Unicode characters.  The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding.  For example</p>
<div class="verbatim"><ol><li>    utf8 "\xE4" does not map to Unicode</li></ol></div><p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'X'-outside-of-string"></a><strong>'X' outside of string</strong>
<p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being (un)packed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="'x'-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a><strong>'x' outside of string in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="YOU-HAVEN'T-DISABLED-SET-ID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET!"></a><strong>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</strong>
<p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around
your script.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="You-need-to-quote-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>You need to quote "%s"</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p>
</li>
<li><a id="Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random"></a><strong>Your random numbers are not that random</strong>
<p>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could
not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
